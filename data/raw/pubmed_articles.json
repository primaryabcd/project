    "abstract": "Normative models of brain metrics based on large populations are extremely valuable for detecting brain abnormalities in patients with dementia, psychiatric, or developmental conditions. Here we present the first large-scale normative model of the brain's white matter (WM) microstructure derived from 18 international diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets covering almost the entire lifespan (totaling N=51,830 individuals; age: 3-80 years). We extracted regional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics using a standardized analysis and quality control protocol, and used Hierarchical Bayesian Regression (HBR) to model the statistical distribution of derived WM metrics as a function of age and sex, while modeling the site effect. HBR overcomes known weaknesses of some data harmonization methods that simply scale and shift residual distributions at each site. To illustrate the method, we applied it to detect and visualize profiles of WM microstructural deviations in cohorts of patients with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease and in carriers of 22q11.2 copy number variants, a rare neurogenetic condition that confers increased risk for psychosis. The resulting large-scale model offers a common reference to identify disease effects in individuals or groups, as well as to compare disorders and discover factors that influence these abnormalities.",

The inclusion criteria for the study were persistent ulnar-sided wrist pain, even after a minimum of 3 months of nonoperative treatment, the presence of a chondral lesion on the lunate, and an intact triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) based on arthroscopic evaluation. Postoperative clinical and subjective functional outcomes were assessed using measures such as wrist range of motion (ROM), grip strength, the Turkish version of the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand questionnaire (Quick DASH), and pain levels measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) and were compared with preoperative values. Patient satisfaction was also evaluated postoperatively. <b>Results</b>  The mean follow-up period was 42.2 months (range: 24-68 months). Postoperatively, none of the patients experienced any restriction in ROM. Grip measurements significantly increased after the surgery ( <i>p</i>  = 0.003). Preoperatively, the patients had a grip strength of 41.14 kg (range 28-48 kg), which improved to 44 kg (range 30-52 kg) postoperatively. Postoperative VAS values and QDASH scores significantly decreased compared with the preoperative values ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001, <i>p</i>  = 0.001). The mean VAS score decreased from 6.1 (range 4-8) preoperatively to 0.9 (range 0-5) postoperatively. The mean Quick DASH score decreased from 49.44 (range 25-68.3) preoperatively to 10.13 (range 3.3-36) postoperatively. When asked about their satisfaction with the operation, 13 out of 14 patients reported being highly satisfied with the results. <b>Conclusions</b>  The reverse wafer procedure presents an alternative treatment option for ulnar impaction syndrome in cases where the TFCC is intact. The mid-term results of this described technique are promising. However, further comparative studies with longer follow-ups are necessary to support these findings. <b>Level of Evidence</b>  IV Therapeutic.",

Unfortunately, neither of them is completely effective and systemic adverse events have been reported after finasteride administration. Triple Hair Inc. has developed a new topical treatment regimen using a combination of finasteride, latanoprost and minoxidil - TH07. Each of the compounds was effective and safe as a topical treatment in animal models and clinical studies of AGA. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the TH07 in comparison to the 3 drugs as monotherapy on hair growth in men with AGA. Patients with light to moderate AGA were randomized to be treated topically, once daily, for 6 months with TH07, 0.1% finasteride, 0.03% latanoprost, or 5% minoxidil. Data of investigators' assessment based on pictures, as well as patients' self-assessment and satisfaction, were collected. A moderate hair re-growth in the majority of the participant treated with TH07 in comparison to the retreatment with its active components administered as monotherapy was reported by the investigators. Most of the patients treated with TH07 were satisfied with their hair appearance in comparison to the other treatments. No systemic adverse events were reported and the TH07 was well tolerated. The data of the current study demonstrated that the topical administration of TH07 resulted in an improved efficacy in the treatment of the AGA compared to treatment with each of the ingredients administered separately.",

The two current biosimilars available in dermatology in the United States (US) are infliximab and rituximab which were Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2016 and 2018 respectively. There has been significant interest in this topic as a number of biosimilar versions of adalimumab will be available in 2023. This review will discuss biosimilar basics and the experience with biosimilars used in dermatology in the US, Asia, and Europe. All articles in Ovid/Medline from 2015 to Feb 2023 on biosimilars were reviewed with a particular emphasis on medications used in dermatology. Other reports from pharmaceutical manufacturers and blogs following the development of the biosimilar industry provided key insights. Biosimilars have been able to produce significant savings and market share increases, particularly in Europe, where there has been a longer experience. The specifics depend on drug prescribing practices and incentives in the individual country. This degree of savings and market share increases have not been realized with the current biosimilars available in the US. While biosimilars have resulted in significant savings compared to originator drugs, it is clear that prescribing incentives and physician education are crucial in achieving these savings. To what degree biosimilar market share will increase in the US remains to be determined.",

Previous research has shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) boosts cortical neurotrophic factors, potentially addressing this loss. The current study aimed to expand these findings by measuring brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its downstream hippocampal signaling molecules, and behavioral effects of rTMS on the 3xTg-AD mouse line. 3xTg-AD (n = 24) and B6 wild-type controls (n = 26), aged 12 months, were given 14 days of consecutive rTMS at 10 Hz for 10 min. Following treatment, mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests and biochemical analysis of BDNF and its downstream cascades were evaluated via Western blot and ELISA. Results showed that brain stimulation did improve performance on the Object Place Task and increased hippocampal TrkB, ERK, and PLCγ in 3xTg-AD mice with minimal effects on wild-type mice. There was no significant difference in the levels of AKT and Truncated TrkB (TrkB.T1) between treatment and sham. Thus, rTMS has the potential to provide an efficacious non-invasive therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease through activation of neurotrophic factor signaling.",

Each of these events would bring significant challenges to clinicians caring for patients with burns and traumatic injuries who are also contaminated or irradiated. The result of a nuclear exchange in a densely populated area could result in thousands of patients presenting with trauma, burns, and combined injury (trauma and burn in an irradiated patient). In this review, we will discuss the three major types of ionizing radiation: alpha, beta, and gamma, and their respective health hazards and biological effects. Additionally, we will discuss the types of burn injuries in a nuclear disaster, caring for the contaminated patient, and managing the combined injury of burn trauma with acute radiation syndrome. The reader will also be left with an understanding of how to prioritize lifesaving interventions, estimate the absorbed dose of radiation, and predict the onset of acute radiation syndrome. While some animal models for morbidity and mortality exist, there is limited modern day human data for patients with combined injury and burns associated with a nuclear disaster due to the infrequent nature of these events. It is extremely important to continue multidisciplinary research on the prevention of, preparedness for, and the response to nuclear events. Furthermore, continued exploration of novel treatments for radiation induced burns and the management of combined injury is necessary.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this investigation is to examine the efficacy and safety of insulin icodec when compared to regular basal insulin for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A comprehensive search was conducted on the Cochrane Library, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Medline databases up until August 19th, 2023. This review incorporates literature that examines the comparison between insulin icodec and basal insulin. The risk of bias was assessed by using RoB v2 tool from Cochrane Collaborations. We employed random-effect models to analyze the mean difference (MD) and odds ratio (OR) for presentation of the outcomes. A total of nine trials with 3,963 participants were incorporated. Five included trials had \"low-risk\" of bias, whereas the remaining four trials had \"some-concern\" risk of bias due to protocol deviations from intended intervention. The results of our meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the reduction of HbA1c levels between insulin icodec and regular basal insulin (MD -0.11 %; 95 %CI: -0.23, 0.01, p = 0.08, I<sup>2</sup> = 91 %). The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight change from baseline also did not differ significantly between two groups. Meanwhile, the total adverse events (TAEs) were shown to be higher in the insulin icodec; however, the serious AEs (SAEs) and clinically significant hypoglycemia did not differ significantly between insulin icodec and these active controls. This study suggests similar efficacy and safety between insulin icodec and regular basal insulin. Further clinical trials are still needed to confirm the results of our study. CRD42023453635.",

Data from the medical records of 126 patients with T2DM who underwent kidney biopsy between January 2010 and October 2020 at a single-center were retrospectively reviewed to investigate the clinical factors that predict DN. Urine samples were collected to perform urine metabolomics in patients with T2DM divided by biopsy-confirmed DN, immunoglobulin A, and membranous nephropathy, and a control group of healthy participants. Each group comprised 11 age- and sex-matched participants. A prediction model was developed using a combination of clinical factors and urinary metabolites, and a multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted. Age, presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, T2DM duration, and hemoglobin A1c levels were clinical factors predictive of DN. Four urinary metabolites (alanine, choline, N-phenylacetylglycine, and trigonelline) had variable importance in projection scores > 1 and were predictive of DN. When conducting multivariate ROC analysis with a combination of clinical factors and urinary metabolites, the area under the curve was 1.000. The combination of clinical factors and urinary metabolites is highly valuable for predicting biopsy-confirmed DN in patients with T2DM.",

This study was performed to understand the glucocorticoid receptor's (GR's) effects on chemokine and acute-phase protein expression in human liver, in settings of bacterial infection (modeled using LPS) or inflammation (modeled using TNF<i>α</i>). Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were treated with combinations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF<i>α</i>), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and dexamethasone (DEX) for 24 h, following which chemokine mRNA and protein expression were analyzed using qPCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays. Dual luciferase assays were performed on transfected cell lines. Mutant CXCL2 promoters were used in dual luciferase assays to identify specific regions of the CXCL2 promoter affected by GR, TNF<i>α</i>, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 4<i>α</i> (HNF4<i>α</i>, a liver-enriched transcription factor). In PHH from donor 1, GR strongly inhibited LPS-induced CXCL1 and CXCL8 translation and transcription, whereas CXCL2 transcription tended to increase with DEX treatment. In PHH from donor 2, DEX treatment inhibited protein expression and secretion of CXCL1 and CXCL8 induced by TNF<i>α</i> and/or LPS, whereas CXCL2 upregulation was largely unaffected by DEX treatment. In nonliver HEK293T cells GR activity inhibited CXCL2 promoter activity. However, in liver-derived HEPG2 cells, GR induced CXCL2 promoter activity. A 407-base pair region upstream of CXCL2 promoter is necessary for full GR functionality in HEPG2 cells. TNF<i>α</i> synergized with HNF4<i>α</i> in inducing CXCL2 promoter activity in HEPG2 cells. GR's effects on chemokine expression are cell-type specific and chemokine specific. GR down-regulated CXCL1 and CXCL8 in different cell types, whereas the specific activation of CXCL2 in hepatocytes and down-regulation of CXCL2 in nonhepatocytes by GR appears due to cell-specific utilization of CXCL2 promoter. By specifically increasing GR activity in the liver, we may normalize chemokine imbalances and prevent sepsis in inflammatory liver diseases.",

    "abstract": "The human neurovascular system is a complex network of blood vessels and brain cells that is essential to the proper functioning of the brain. In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in the role of this system in developing drugs to treat neuroinflammation. This process is believed to contribute to the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. While much remains to be learned about the precise mechanisms by which the neurovascular system interacts with the brain and how it can be targeted for therapeutic purposes, this area of research holds great promise for the future of neurology and medicine. Currently, creating neurovascular models begins with animal models, followed by testing on humans in clinical trials. However, the high number of medication failures that pass through animal testing indicates that animal models do not always reflect the outcome of human clinical trials. To overcome the challenges of neurovascular systems and the issues with animal models, we have developed a one-of-a-kind <i>in vitro</i> neurovascular unit-on-a-chip to accurately replicate the <i>in vivo</i> human neurovascular microenvironment. This neuroinflammation-on-a-chip platform has the potential to enhance the current methods of drug development and testing to treat neurodegenerative diseases. By replicating the human neurovascular unit in vitro, a more accurate representation of human physiology can be achieved compared to animal models. The ability to detect pro-inflammatory cytokines in situ and monitor physiological changes, such as barrier function, in real-time can provide an invaluable tool for evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs. Moreover, using nano-sized graphene oxide for in situ detection of inflammatory responses is an innovative approach that can advance the field of neuroinflammation research. <i>Overall</i>, our developed neuroinflammation-on-a-chip system has the potential to provide a more efficient and effective method for developing drugs for treating neurodegenerative diseases and other central nervous system (CNS) diseases.",

This article introduces the concept of primals to developmental scientists and reviews preliminary research examining how primals relate to sociodemographic and well-being indicators. The article then situates the concept of primals in some classic developmental theories to illustrate testable hypotheses these theories suggest regarding how primals develop.

Chiral thiourea dual-hydrogen bond donors were initially found to promote enantioselective dichloromethyl boronate rearrangements, albeit with poor reproducibility. Systematic investigations of the fate of the thiourea led to the discovery that lithium-isothiourea-boronate derivatives were being generated in situ as highly enantioselective catalytically active species. The optimal lithium-isothiourea-boronate catalyst displays significant generality in the rearrangement of primary alkyl migrating groups, affording synthetically valuable α-chloro boronic ester products with consistently high enantioselectivities. The catalyst is proposed to act as a structurally rigid chiral framework that precisely positions two lithium cations to enable a dual-lithium-mediated chloride abstraction.",

    "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are debilitating mental illnesses that can lead to significant medical complications from malnutrition. Eating disorders are on the rise in Asia and the prevalence is expected to increase. The aim of this study was to understand the characteristics of local patients and evaluate our current inpatient nutritional rehabilitation protocol for anorexia nervosa (AN). Retrospective descriptive data were gathered from 47 patients diagnosed with AN. Patients with admissions were further stratified according to their nutritional management based on whether they were on the AN protocol or standard hospital care. Data on their rate of weight gain, length of stay and calorie prescription were collected. Similar to previous studies, the majority of AN patients were female (96.7%). However, the age at presentation of AN in this study, as compared with previous local studies, had decreased (14 vs. 16 years). We also found that patients on the AN protocol were prescribed a higher amount of calories than those given standard care (2,700 vs. 2,317 calories). Patients on the AN protocol achieved a higher rate of weight gain per week (1.15 vs. 0.29 kg) and had a shorter length of hospital stay (23 vs. 36 days). Patients with AN appear to be presenting at a younger age. Medical stabilisation of AN patients can be achieved more quickly through a higher calorie inpatient AN treatment protocol. Future local studies examining actual calorie consumption, its effect on weight gain trajectory, severity of refeeding syndrome and time to remission will be beneficial.",

While the concept of pleiotropy is as old as Mendelian genetics, functional genomics has finally allowed the first glimpses of the extent of pleiotropy for a large fraction of genes in a genome. After describing conceptual and operational difficulties in quantifying pleiotropy and the pros and cons of various methods for measuring pleiotropy, I review empirical data on pleiotropy, which generally show an L-shaped distribution of the degree of pleiotropy (i.e., the number of traits affected) with most genes having low pleiotropy. I then review the current understanding of the molecular basis of pleiotropy. The rest of the review discusses evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on advances in topics including the cost of complexity, regulatory <i>vs</i>. coding evolution, environmental pleiotropy and adaptation, evolution of ageing and other seemingly harmful traits, and evolutionary resolution of pleiotropy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor symptoms. Ongoing research shows promise for long-term solutions. Studies highlight the dysregulation of Syt11 and α-synuclein (α-syn) in PD. Disrupted α-syn homeostasis due to palmitoylation of Syt11 contributes to its aggregation, potentially playing a role in PD pathology. α-synuclein aggregates in stool samples show promise as an early diagnostic biomarker. Vocal impairments in PD may be linked to α-syn-induced neuropathology. Irisin, produced after exercise, promotes the degradation of pathologic α-syn. Progress has been made in identifying PD biomarkers. Retinal thinning and abnormal protein aggregates in skin biopsies provide noninvasive diagnostic indicators. Blood-based biomarkers like α-syn, DJ-1, and LRRK2 hold promise but face limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) models enhance mitophagy, detect PD through sleep-breathing signals, and improve survival. AI analysis aids noninvasive assessment and risk prediction. Further understanding of PD involves studying pathological seeds and genetic mutations. Adenosine receptor regulation relates to early-onset PD, and specific gene mutations impact patient survival. Differentiated-induced pluripotent stem cells offer the potential for cell replacement therapy. Autoimmune features and T-cell involvement suggest intervention targets. Stem cell-based therapies and neurostimulation strategies show promise for improving motor function. Imaging reveals increased central inflammation in PD, suggesting an inflammatory role. Machine learning algorithms and home gait speed monitoring aid in diagnosis and disease progression tracking. Abnormal putamen gradients reflect dopaminergic loss and motor dysfunction. Antiepileptic drug prescriptions are associated with an increased PD risk. Personalized medicine, gut-brain axis involvement, and vestibular stimulation therapy offer potential PD treatment avenues. Genetic engineering techniques and deep brain stimulation show promise for alleviating PD symptoms. Ongoing research and technological advancements promise to improve PD screening, diagnosis, and treatment, bringing hope to affected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Mainstream poverty analysis currently renders certain people and degrees of privation more socially legible than others across high-income countries. This article examines how these hierarchies carry through to and corrupt wider social scientific analysis, inscribing differential value to actors and phenomena in ways that undermine social understanding and explanation. First, conventional approaches to poverty analysis and measurement obscure the <i>de facto</i> prevalence of deep poverty, as well as those most subject to its violence. Second, a growing number of hyper-marginalised groups are missing from population income surveys, undermining the accuracy of (deep) poverty estimates and public understanding of both its determinants and dynamics. Third, the inferential and external validity of income surveys is significantly diminished by problems surrounding data quality and coverage. Attempts to address this have principally focused on improving data quality, but as demonstrated in this article, these strategies exacerbate poor representation of the lowest-income groups in distributional analysis. Much more than merely technical or pragmatic, these are theoretical and normative judgements about who counts in welfare policy and politics. Overall, I demonstrate how current data practices occlude some the most violent forms of denigration and exploitation that structure advanced marginality, particularly the gendered, racialised, bordering and ableist practices underpinning state-citizen dynamics. Focusing principally on the UK context, I argue that the epistemic erasure committed features in and systematises a policy blindness to deep poverty for some of the most marginalised social groups making it harder to evidence its effects and address its causes across high-income countries.",

    "abstract": "Light's ability to perform massive linear operations in parallel has recently inspired numerous demonstrations of optics-assisted artificial neural networks (ANN). However, a clear system-level advantage of optics over purely digital ANN has not yet been established. While linear operations can indeed be optically performed very efficiently, the lack of nonlinearity and signal regeneration require high-power, low-latency signal transduction between optics and electronics. Additionally, a large power is needed for lasers and photodetectors, which are often neglected in the calculation of the total energy consumption. Here, instead of mapping traditional digital operations to optics, we co-designed a hybrid optical-digital ANN, that operates on incoherent light, and is thus amenable to operations under ambient light. Keeping the latency and power constant between a purely digital ANN and a hybrid optical-digital ANN, we identified a low-power/latency regime, where an optical encoder provides higher classification accuracy than a purely digital ANN. We estimate our optical encoder enables ∼10 kHz rate operation of a hybrid ANN with a power of only 23 mW. However, in that regime, the overall classification accuracy is lower than what is achievable with higher power and latency. Our results indicate that optics can be advantageous over digital ANN in applications, where the overall performance of the ANN can be relaxed to prioritize lower power and latency.",

This condition is concerning because the government has run a program of giving iron tablets to pregnant women since 1970. This study aimed to determine socioenvironmental factors that cause anemia in pregnant women. This qualitative research used phenomenological methods. In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 mothers with anemia and 12 focus group discussion (FGD) informants. Qualitative data analysis was applied to analyze the data. The study found three factors: anemia in the preconception period, diets that cause a lack of iron consumption, and knowledge and consumption of iron tablets in pregnant women. Anemia in pregnant women is a continuous cycle of anemia which begins in the preconception period. Adolescent eating behavior and supplementation programs for pregnant women integrated with antenatal care are still problematic. The findings of this study provide important information for preventing anemia in pregnant women, increasing counseling, and evaluating the implementation of iron supplementation in pregnant women. The policy of administering iron tablets to pregnant women to prevent anemia is not effective in reducing the prevalence of anemia. This government policy must be accompanied by a community movement program because the findings of this study show the problems that exist in the individual factors of the mother.",

    "abstract": "Ketamine has historically been contraindicated in traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to concern for raising intracranial pressure. However, it is increasingly being used in TBI due to the favorable respiratory and hemodynamic properties. To date, no studies have evaluated whether ketamine administered in subjects with TBI is associated with patient survival or disability. We performed a retrospective analysis of data from the multicenter Prehospital Tranexamic Acid Use for Traumatic Brain Injury trial, comparing ketamine-exposed and ketamine-unexposed TBI subjects to determine whether an association exists between ketamine administration and mortality, as well as secondary outcome measures. We analyzed 841 eligible subjects from the original study, of which 131 (15.5%) received ketamine. Ketamine-exposed subjects were younger (37.3±16.9 years vs. 42.0±18.6 years, P=0.037), had a worse initial Glasgow Coma Scale score (7±3 vs. 8±4, P=0.003), and were more likely to be intubated than ketamine-unexposed subjects (88.5% vs. 44.2%, P<0.001). Overall, there was no difference in mortality (12.2% vs. 15.5%, P=0.391) or disability measures between groups. Ketamine-exposed subjects had significantly fewer instances of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) compared to ketamine-unexposed subjects (56.3% vs. 82.3%, P=0.048). In the very rare outcomes of cardiac events and seizure activity, seizure activity was statistically more likely in ketamine-exposed subjects (3.1% vs. 1.0%, P=0.010). In the intracranial hemorrhage subgroup, cardiac events were more likely in ketamine-exposed subjects (2.3% vs. 0.2%, P=0.025). Ketamine exposure was associated with a smaller increase in TBI protein biomarker concentrations. Ketamine administration was not associated with worse survival or disability despite being administered to more severely injured subjects. Ketamine exposure was associated with reduced elevations of ICP, more instances of seizure activity, and lower concentrations of TBI protein biomarkers.",

We performed a narrative review on spontaneous and induced degradation of dermal fillers <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Hyaluronic acid-based fillers are the most frequently used temporary fillers. The products differ in their hyaluronic acid content, cross-linking, and rheological parameters. Endogenous hyaluronidase and reactive oxygen species are responsible for the spontaneous degradation of these fillers. Hyaluronidase digests the filler material by cleavage of the <i>β</i>-1,4 glycosidic linkage between <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine and <i>D</i>-glucuronic acid. The enzyme can be used for treatment of medical and cosmetic adverse events due to hyaluronic acid-based filler. Higher hyaluronidase content and higher degree of cross-linking are major factors contributing to filler persistence over time. Semipermanent fillers are poly-(<i>D</i>), <i>l</i>-lactic acid and calcium hydroxylapatite. These filler types are decomposed by hydrolysis and osteoclastic enzymes. They usually persist up to 2 years, in single patients even more than 5 years. Sodium thiosulfate can stimulate degradation of calcium hydroxylapatite, but it is slow acting and not effective in case of emergency. Permanent fillers may show some kind of modification <i>in situ</i>, but spontaneous or induced degradation has not been documented. Once implanted the permanent fillers remain lifelong. Intralesional laser treatment supports the removal of permanent filler material as an alternative to surgery. Besides biocompatibility and toxicity, filler materials should also be assessed for degradation to improve patient safety.",

In order to effectively manage burn critical illness, knowledge of pharmacologic parameters and their changes is necessary. It is also imperative that the clinician understands how these changes will affect drug dosing. A common practice is to increase antibiotic dosing and/or frequency; however, this may not be necessary and doses should be adjusted to patient- and drug-specific parameters. Additionally, monitoring assays for antibiotic levels as well as coagulation factors can be useful for adjusting dosages to best treat the patient.

    "abstract": "Complex percutaneous cardiac intervention (PCI) is a growing procedure in modern day cath labs. The treated population is often older, with multiple comorbidities, complex coronary anatomy, left ventricular dysfunction, and possibly concomitant valvular heart disease and/or cardiogenic shock. As such, PCI of bifurcations, chronic total occlusions, and atherectomy coronary interventions are becoming more common. The outcomes in terms of acute procedural success, procedure-related complications, and long-term mortality or heart failure hospitalizations are important to consider. Unfortunately, to date there is a paucity of data identifying sex and gender disparities following such interventions. With respect to bifurcation lesions, women usually have more comorbidities with less complex coronary anatomy. However, despite less complex anatomy, women have a significantly increased risk of MI. These differences are also noted with left main stem and multivessel disease, during which women appear to have a trend towards worse outcomes following PCI compared with coronary artery bypass grafting. Randomized trials have revealed that women present with increased cardiovascular risk factors, which may contribute to adverse longer-term outcomes. Revascularization of women with concomitant valvular heart disease is particularly challenging because the existing data are conflicted on not only the indication, but also the timing of revascularization. Similarly, women undergoing PCI of calcified lesions with drug-eluting stents have a worse clinical profile and remain at increased ischemic risk. The lower incidence of coronary calcification in women, combined with the under-representation of women in randomized trials, poses a real challenge when attempting to address safety and survival benefit in women undergoing complex interventions. This warrants dedicated trials exploring the safety and efficacy of complex interventions in women.",

    "title": "Gallbladder disease in transgender individuals: associations with gender-affirming hormone therapy.",
    "abstract": "Transgender individuals frequently undergo gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) during their gender transition which plays a vital role in gender identity affirmation. Cholelithiasis, a common condition affecting 10-15% of the US population, has been linked to estrogen therapy in cisgender women. Despite the fact that hormonal profiles achieved after GAHT are not always identical to cisgender individuals, the effects of GAHT on gallbladder disease (GBD) risk have not been evaluated in transgender populations. This research aims to address this gap utilizing a large nationwide database. The study analyzed medical records data from the TrinetX database from 52,847 trans men and 38,114 trans women. Four cohorts were created: trans women and men either receiving either hormone therapy or no intervention. Descriptive statistics were calculated before matching to estimate disease burden. The groups were then propensity score matched on known risk factors (age, race, BMI, etc.) and rates of GBD were compared. Before matching, trans women on hormone therapy (TWHT) had a significantly higher 10-year GBD probability than those naïve to therapy (TWNI) (4.69% vs 1.88%). For trans men, there was no significant difference in 10-year rates between those on therapy (TMHT) and those not (TMNI) (3.15% vs 3.87%). Cholecystectomy rates were significantly higher for TWHT than TWNI (1.10% vs. 0.57%), but similar between TMHT and TMNI (0.95% vs. 1.10%). After accounting for risk factors, TWHT had increased GBD risk (HR 1.832), while TMHT showed no significant change. This study suggests a link between estrogen GAHT and increased GBD risk in transgender women. Notably, testosterone GAHT did not offer protection against GBD in transgender men, contrary to expectations. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to describe the burden of GBD in the transgender population and to investigate the effects of GAHT on GBD risk.",

    "abstract": "Serum procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker used to diagnose sepsis and infection. Following invasive bacterial infection, PCT is detectable in peripheral blood. The aim of our study was to determine if there is a relationship between serum PCT post-burn wound debridement and burn-related sepsis. In total, 34 participants were recruited from 1 November 2019 to 31 July 2020. Serum PCT levels were drawn on days 0, 1, 2, and 3, with day 0 being the day of the surgery. Blood culture samples were drawn on days 0 and 3. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA©. Descriptive statistics were presented as the median for continuous data and frequencies for categorical data. A two-sample Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was performed to assess the correlation between the PCT values and blood culture positivity. In all, 33 burn debridement procedures were completed, and 1 patient demised before surgery. The median age was 35.5 years; 61.8% were male. Four patients had comorbidities. There was a trend of higher PCT values from day 0 to day 3. The median PCT on day 0 was 3.30 µg/L (IQR 0.78-15.10), compared to day 3 PCT which was 5.15 µg/L (IQR 1.35-18.55). The median values for serum PCT for days 0 to 3 were above the normal threshold regardless of BC positivity. There was a statistically significant difference in the PCT levels between positive and negative BC, with a <i>p</i> value of 0.0087 for day 3 serum PCT. The findings indicate an association of a high serum PCT level with a positive blood culture in a burn patient post-debridement surgery. A higher numerical threshold/cut-off of serum PCT should be used for this cohort of patients, to aid in the diagnosis of sepsis. A cut-off value could not be determined due to the small sample size.",

    "abstract": "Multidimensional manipulation of photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) has attracted considerable interest due to its potential in a wide variety of spin-based applications. Plenty of research efforts have been devoted to transverse or longitudinal spin-dependent splitting; however, the splitting pattern that can self-rotate in a three-dimensional (3-D) space appears to be missing in literature. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3-D rotational PSHE, which can be realized and tuned using well-designed Pancharatnam-Berry phase metasurfaces. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we first show that when a single dielectric metasurface is used, the lobe-structured spin-splitting patterns on the transverse planes rotate and evolve along the propagation path. Then, we present that under two cascaded metasurfaces, the rotation angle of the splitting patterns are tunable by adjusting the relative rotation angle between the two metasurfaces. Finally, we manifest that the lobe number of the two spin-dependent splitting patterns can be independently controlled once we introduce a dynamic phase, which produces an asymmetrical rotational PSHE. The demonstrated phenomena can be used to achieve active manipulation of spin photons in multiple dimensions, and the developed device might find potential applications in various areas, e.g., optical microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Metasurfaces, composed of artificial meta-atoms of subwavelength size, can support strong light-matter interaction based on multipolar resonances and plasmonics, hence offering the great capability of empowering nonlinear generation. Recently, owing to their ability to manipulate the amplitude and phase of the nonlinear emission in the subwavelength scale, metasurfaces have been recognized as ultra-compact, flat optical components for a vast range of applications, including nonlinear imaging, quantum light sources, and ultrasensitive sensing. This review focuses on the recent progress on nonlinear metasurfaces for those applications. The principles and advances of metasurfaces-based techniques for image generation, including image encoding, holography, and metalens, are investigated and presented. Additionally, the overview and development of spontaneous photon pair generation from metasurfaces are demonstrated and discussed, focusing on the aspects of photon pair generation rate and entanglement of photon pairs. The recent blossoming of the nonlinear metasurfaces field has triggered growing interest to explore its ability to efficiently up-convert infrared images of arbitrary objects to visible images and achieve spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This recently emerged direction holds promising potential for the next-generation technology in night-vision, quantum computing, and biosensing fields.",

    "abstract": "Posttranscriptional RNA modification is an important mode of epigenetic regulation in various biological and pathological contexts. N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) is one of the most abundant methylation modifications in mammals and usually occurs at the first transcribed nucleotide. Accumulating evidence indicates that m6Am modifications have important roles in RNA metabolism and physiological and pathological processes. PCIF1 (phosphorylated C-terminal domain interacting factor 1) is a protein that can bind to the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II through its WW domain. PCIF1 is named after this binding ability. Recently, PCIF1 has been identified as a cap-specific adenine N6-methyltransferase responsible for m6Am formation. Discovered as the sole m6Am methyltransferase for mammalian mRNA, PCIF1 has since received more extensive and in-depth study. Dysregulation of PCIF1 contributes to various pathological processes. Targeting PCIF1 may hold promising therapeutic significance. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of PCIF1. We explore the current understanding of the structure and the biological characteristics of PCIF1. We further review the molecular mechanisms of PCIF1 in cancer and viral infection and discuss its therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes, extracellular vesicles originating from endosomes, were discovered in the late 1980s and their function in intercellular communication has since garnered considerable interest. Exosomes are lipid bilayer-coated vesicles that range in size from 30 to 150 nm and appear as sacs under the electron microscope. Exosome secretion is crucial for cell-to-cell contact in both normal physiology and the development and spread of tumors. Furthermore, cancer cells can secrete more exosomes than normal cells. Scientists believe that intercellular communication in the complex tissue environment of the human body is an important reason for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. For example, some particles containing regulatory molecules are secreted in the tumor microenvironment, including exosomes. Then the contents of exosomes can be released by donor cells into the environment and interact with recipient cells to promote the migration and invasion of tumor cells. Therefore, in this review, we summarized the biogenesis of exosome, as well as exosome cargo and related roles. More importantly, this review introduces and discusses the factors that have been reported to affect exosome secretion in tumors and highlights the important role of exosomes in tumors.",

The objective of this article was to perform a systematic review of the articles published on third molar displacement during the surgical procedure, analyzing the predisposing factors, the cause, symptomatology, and treatment used to resolve this complication. A systematic review was performed. The review included articles on displacement of third molars to different anatomical spaces; articles dealing with displacement of teeth other than third molars, displacement of surgical instruments or displacement of materials were excluded. Fifty articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most frequent site to which a third molar is displaced in the maxilla is to the infratemporal fossa while in the mandible it is to the submandibular space. The incidence was higher in women than in men with a 2:1 rate. When displacement occurs, the risk/benefit of immediate or delayed extraction should be assessed. If there is a risk to vital structures and there is no symptomatology, it can be kept under follow-up. CBCT is the best method for preoperative localization.",

    "abstract": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a prevalent comorbidity among patients with psoriasis, heavily contributing to their burden of disease, usually diagnosed several years after the diagnosis of psoriasis. To investigate the predictability of psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis and to identify important predictors. Data from the Swiss Dermatology Network on Targeted Therapies (SDNTT) involving patients treated for psoriasis were utilized. A combination of gradient-boosted decision trees and mixed models was used to classify patients based on their diagnosis of PsA or its absence. The variables with the highest predictive power were identified. Time to PsA diagnosis was visualized with the Kaplan-Meier method and the relationship between severity of psoriasis and PsA was explored through quantile regression. A diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis was registered at baseline of 407 (29.5%) treatment series. 516 patients had no registration of PsA, 257 patients had PsA at inclusion, and 91 patients were diagnosed with PsA after inclusion. The model's AUROCs was up to 73.7%, and variables with the highest discriminatory power were age, PASI, physical well-being, and severity of nail psoriasis. Among patients who developed PsA after inclusion, significantly more first treatment series were classified in the PsA-group, compared to those with no PsA registration. PASI was significantly correlated with the median burden/severity of PsA (<i>P</i> = .01). Distinguishing between patients with and without PsA based on clinical characteristics is feasible and even predicting future diagnoses of PsA is possible. Patients at higher risk can be identified using important predictors of PsA.",

Traditional molecular biology methods are limited in their ability to unravel cellular-level heterogeneity within woody plant tissues. Consequently, techniques such as single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell epigenetics, and spatial transcriptomics are rapidly gaining popularity in the study of woody plants. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the development of these technologies, with a focus on their applications and the challenges they present in single-cell transcriptome research in woody plants. In particular, we delve into the similarities and differences among the results of current studies and analyze the reasons behind these differences. Furthermore, we put forth potential solutions to overcome the challenges encountered in single-cell transcriptome applications in woody plants. Finally, we discuss the application directions of these techniques to address key challenges in woody plant research in the future.",

Establishing familiarity with the LSO technique and its features as compared with other anterolateral approaches is an important component of advanced skull base training. We present a step-by-step demonstration of the LSO approach using cadaveric dissection in a manner that is digestible for trainees at various levels. <b>Design</b>  This is anatomic step-by-step dissection and representative case series. <b>Setting</b>  This study was carried out in the cadaveric dissection laboratory. <b>Participants</b>  A formalin-fixed, latex-injected cadaveric head specimen was dissected under microscopic magnification by a neurosurgery resident under faculty supervision. Following dissection, representative case applications were reviewed. <b>Main Outcome Measures</b>  Dissection and case illustration were the main outcome measures. <b>Results</b>  A single-layer myocutaneous flap is developed, and a single-burr-hole technique is used, followed by extensive drilling of the sphenoid wing. The dura is opened in a C-shaped fashion centered on the Sylvian fissure, exposing the inferior frontal and superior temporal lobes. Labeled photographs of dissections with pertinent anatomical structures are presented. Three case examples illustrating the versatility of the LSO approach, including the resection of a large pituitary adenoma, an inferior frontal melanoma metastasis presenting to the Sylvian surface, and a frontoinsular low-grade glioma, are reviewed. <b>Conclusion</b>  As compared with the pterional craniotomy, the LSO approach involves a shorter incision, smaller craniotomy, and faster exposure; it can be conveniently tailored to various indications. Understanding the step-by-step dissection and indications of the LSO approach is of paramount importance to neurosurgery trainees.",

    "abstract": "Despite numerous published papers, diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in children is still an undefined area. The importance of this topic lies in the fact that one third of the world's population is infected with <i>Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis</i>. The majority of infected individuals are LTBI cases which make a reservoir for future active tuberculosis (TB) patients. The gold standard for LTBI detection is still undetermined and this is due to the effect of various confounding factors on existing diagnostic tests. Until a decade or so ago, throughout the last century, tuberculin skin test (TST) was the only diagnostic test for LTBI. Due to scientific advances, new <i>in vitro</i> assays, interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) were discovered recently. The sensitivities of IGRAs are a bit better than those of TST, while great progress has been made in increasing the specificity of IGRA relative to TST. Nevertheless, in the diagnosis of LTBI in children, TST still has some advantages. However, generations of IGRAs have brought many diagnostic advantages that are emphasized in this review. In a difficult procedure of diagnosing LTBI in children, performance of IGRA could be the key factor in making decision whether to use preventive therapy or not.",

Drawing on the foundational criticisms of this metric made by Simon Kuznets, it is argued that, for this period of British economic history, shortfalls in measured GDP growth in comparison with other rich countries are a very poor measure of changes in economic well-being in the UK. If we follow this argument and discard the belief that one metric can summarize trends in such well-being, the notion of 'failure' in this period should be set aside in favour of a more nuanced, multidimensional assessment.",

The Ronan Point disaster is frequently cited as a symbolic 'turning point' in the urban history of Britain, but it has been surprisingly underexplored on an archival level. It has been identified as a moment at which high-rise architecture was overwhelmingly discredited: a defining event within narratives of 'urban crisis' and 'decline' in late twentieth-century Britain. This article proposes that the Ronan Point scandal should be understood as a moment of democratic crisis, rather than one unique to the 'inner city'. The disaster foregrounded a profound democratic deficit within the political culture of post-war reconstruction. However, this article revises standard narratives of the Ronan Point disaster exclusively as a moment of crisis to consider it dually as a moment of possibility for the British welfare state, and for social democracy. The scandal constituted a key moment at which anti-deferential discourses were harnessed by grassroots actors to challenge the legitimacy of technocratic expertise and to lobby for a more participatory reimagination of the post-war settlement. The article goes on, nevertheless, to explore how such discourses of empowerment would also be mobilized to justify a movement away from public housing and towards owner-occupation.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional layered semiconductors have attracted intense interest in recent years. The van der Waals coupling between the layers tolerates stacking various materials and establishing heterostructures with new characteristics for a wide range of optoelectronic applications. The interlayer exciton dynamics at the interface within the heterostructure are vitally important for the performance of the photodetector and photovoltaic device. Here, a heterostructure comprising two-dimensional organic-inorganic Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites and transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer was fabricated and its ultrafast charge separation processes were systematically studied by using femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. Significant hole and electron transfer processes in the ps and fs magnitude at the interface of the heterostructure were observed by tuning pump wavelengths of the pump-probe geometries. The results emphasize the realization of the exciton devices based on semiconductor heterostructures of two-dimensional perovskite and transition metal dichalcogenide.",

    "title": "Assessment and Management of Suicide Risk: What Psychiatrists Should Know.",
    "abstract": "Suicide is a major public health issue worldwide, and scholars now recognise the multifactorial perspective of this phenomenon. However, psychiatric disorders are often considered the main determinant of suicide risk, and psychiatrists are commonly requested to assess and manage such a risk. The establishment of the medical model suggests that treating mental disorders prioritises reducing the probability of a suicidal gesture. However, this model appears obsolete and implies that the entire management of such a complex phenomenon relies on psychiatrists' treatments. In their central role, psychiatrists and other figures can reasonably anticipate the future by proper suicide risk assessment and appropriate documentation of therapeutic plans. In its unpredictability, clinicians should relate the suicidal phenomenon to foreseeability, with proper implementation of the standard of care, which ensures adequate protection from medical-legal instances. Psychiatrists should be trained to assess and manage suicide risk through clinical skills while fostering alliances with patients, families, and other clinicians. The article introduces the importance of suicide risk formulation, the correct categorisation of each patient by an in-depth study of the suicidal scenario, and the role of mental pain as a critical factor for reducing the main sources of suffering in each unique patient.",

    "abstract": "OpenAI's ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot that answers questions and performs writing tasks in a conversational tone. Within months of release, multiple sectors are contemplating the varied applications of this chatbot, including medicine, education, and research, all of which are involved in medical communication and scientific publishing. Medical writers and academics use several artificial intelligence (AI) tools and software for research, literature survey, data analyses, referencing, and writing. There are benefits of using different AI tools in medical writing. However, using chatbots for medical communications pose some major concerns such as potential inaccuracies, data bias, security, and ethical issues. Perceived incorrect notions also limit their use. Moreover, ChatGPT can also be challenging if used incorrectly and for irrelevant tasks. If used appropriately, ChatGPT will not only upgrade the knowledge of the medical writer but also save time and energy that could be directed toward more creative and analytical areas requiring expert skill sets. This review introduces chatbots, outlines the progress in ChatGPT research, elaborates the potential uses of ChatGPT in medical communications along with its challenges and limitations, and proposes future research perspectives. It aims to provide guidance for doctors, researchers, and medical writers on the uses of ChatGPT in medical communications.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear Medicine plays an important role in the management of patients with chronic diseases, especially oncological and cardiovascular conditions. In this study, an analysis of the evolution of this field in Brazil was conducted within the framework of the Unified Health System. Retrospective analyses from 2015 to 2021 of public data were performed. Although Brazil has a considerable number of facilities, their geographical distribution is uneven. The same disparity is observed in relation to units that produce and distribute radiopharmaceuticals, limiting access for the Brazilian population, particularly to those with a half-life of less than two hours. There is a noticeable high technological dependence on foreign companies, with little or no domestic production, contributing to a deficit in the trade balance. Despite the increasing demands due to factors such as population aging and epidemiological changes, the area did not expand. It is crucial to implement social and economic policies to reduce vulnerabilities in the public healthcare system, ensure its sustainability, and promote equal and universal access to Nuclear Medicine.",

The present study aims to review the prevalence of seizures in COVID-19 patients considering sex and geographical origin. A review protocol was submitted to the PROSPERO database (CRD42021281467). PRISMA statement was used to report the meta-analysis. The authors selected studies for the meta-analysis by searching the principal databases. Studies were eligible if they reported seizures in COVID-19 patients, regardless of study design. Data were analyzed by proportion meta-analysis with a 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). Cochran's Q and Higgins' I<sup>2</sup> were used to measure heterogeneity. R software was used for meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were carried out for sex, geographical origin of the subjects, and illness severity. A checklist for prevalence studies was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. A total of 32 studies (n = 251,997 analyzed patients) were included in this meta-analysis. A prevalence of 1.03 % (95 % CI 0.73 to 1.37, I<sup>2</sup> = 93 %, p < 0.001) was found. No statistically significant differences were found in the analysis by geographical subgroups. Men were found to be less likely to had COVID-19 seizures (OR = 0.75, 95 % CI 0.21-2.74), while mildly ill patients were found to be more likely to had COVID-19-induced seizures (OR = 2.08, 95 % CI 0.86-5.06). Our results show a slight prevalence of seizures in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we found that the groups analyzed had differences in the odds of having COVID-19-induced seizures.",

    "abstract": "Nanophotonic devices manipulate light at sub-wavelength scales, enabling tasks such as light concentration, routing, and filtering. Designing these devices to achieve precise light-matter interactions using structural parameters and materials is a challenging task. Traditionally, solving this problem has relied on computationally expensive, iterative methods. In recent years, deep learning techniques have emerged as promising tools for tackling the inverse design of nanophotonic devices. While several review articles have provided an overview of the progress in this rapidly evolving field, there is a need for a comprehensive tutorial that specifically targets newcomers without prior experience in deep learning. Our goal is to address this gap and provide practical guidance for applying deep learning to individual scientific problems. We introduce the fundamental concepts of deep learning and critically discuss the potential benefits it offers for various inverse design problems in nanophotonics. We present a suggested workflow and detailed, practical design guidelines to help newcomers navigate the challenges they may encounter. By following our guide, newcomers can avoid frustrating roadblocks commonly experienced when venturing into deep learning for the first time. In a second part, we explore different iterative and direct deep learning-based techniques for inverse design, and evaluate their respective advantages and limitations. To enhance understanding and facilitate implementation, we supplement the manuscript with detailed Python notebook examples, illustrating each step of the discussed processes. While our tutorial primarily focuses on researchers in (nano-)photonics, it is also relevant for those working with deep learning in other research domains. We aim at providing a solid starting point to empower researchers to leverage the potential of deep learning in their scientific pursuits.",

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of optical holography, moving from volume holography based on optically thick holograms to digital holography using ultrathin metasurface holograms in nanophotonics. We review the use of volume holograms for holographic multiplexing through the linear momentum selectivity and other approaches and highlight the emerging use of digital holograms that can be implemented by ultrathin metasurfaces. We will summarize the fabrication of different holographic recording media and digital holograms based on recent advances in flat meta-optics and nanotechnology. We highlight the rapidly developing field of metasurface holography, presenting the use of multi-functional metasurfaces for multiplexing holography in the use of polarization, wavelength, and incident angle of light. In the scope of holographic applications, we will focus on high bandwidth metasurface holograms that offer the strong sensitivity to the orbital angular momentum of light. At the end, we will provide a short summary of this review article and our perspectives on the future development of the vivid holography field.",

    "title": "Systematic review: oral and maxillofacial radiology as fundamental methods of virtual autopsy.",
    "abstract": "Refusal of autopsy occurs for various reasons, including religious beliefs and the risk of infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019. Dental autopsy involves invasive procedures, including incision and access openings in the oral cavity. Radiographic techniques can be used as an alternative to the conventional autopsy process in the field of forensic odontology, providing a non-invasive approach that does not involve tissue damage. The current study aimed to analyse the current status of the applicability of oral and maxillofacial radiology for virtual forensic odontological autopsy. A systematic review was conducted in accord with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis protocol. The literature search was conducted from December 2021 to October 2022 using the PubMed, ScienceDirect, and SAGE Journals databases. Article selection was carried out by eliminating duplication, screening titles and abstracts, and reading the entire content of the article. A thematic analysis method was used to identify themes in the collected data. A total of 15 articles were included, and several uses of oral and maxillofacial radiography in virtual autopsy and forensic odontology were identified. Four techniques were identified that can be used for virtual autopsy in forensic odontology. The use of computed tomography (CT) scanning for virtual autopsy was reported in six articles, cone beam CT was reported in five articles, magnetic resonance imaging was reported in two articles, and multidetector CT was reported in two articles. In the studies included in this review, the identified oral and maxillofacial radiograph techniques that are used as the fundamental methods of virtual autopsy in forensic odontology are CT scanning (including multidetector CT), cone beam CT, and magnetic resonance imaging. The different methods of oral and maxillofacial radiography for virtual autopsy were identified as having advantages as well as limitations in their use in forensic odontology. Most of the included studies indicated that the virtual autopsy approach cannot yet stand alone as an identification method, but provides a useful adjunct for gathering dental evidence. Virtual autopsy is a valuable tool for non-invasive autopsies in the field of forensic odontology.CT scans (including MDCT), CBCT, and MRI can be used for virtual autopsy in the identification of individuals based on dental evidence.The use of oral and maxillofacial radiographs can shorten the time required for forensic odontology activities.Artefacts caused by amalgam and other metal restorations on radiographic images can raise doubts in the identification process.Although the use of oral and maxillofacial radiology has many advantages, it cannot yet stand alone as an identification method.",

Fifty-five infants from 0 to 2 months of age underwent clinical examination for ankyloglossia, after which they were offered a silicone pacifier connected to the pressure acquisitiondevice and suction activity was recorded. Thus, we extracted the frequency of sucks within a burst, the average suck duration, the burst duration, the number of sucks per burst, the maximum amplitude of sucks per burst and the inter-burst interval. The key difference in newborns with ankyloglossia in relation to control was that they perform longer bursts of suction activity. The longer burst durations are likely a compensatory strategy and may underlie the pain reported by mothers during breastfeeding. We therefore propose a method for objectively quantifying some parameters of infant suction capacity and demonstrate its use in assisting the evaluation of ankyloglossia.",

Mechanism exploration involves anesthesia and surgery that lead to microglial activation, promote the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory factors, cause an inflammatory cascade, aggravate nerve cell damage, and lead to cognitive dysfunction. It is believed that microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory responses play a vital role in the formation of PND. Microglia surface receptors are essential mediators for microglia to receive external stimuli, regulate microglial functional status, and carry out intercellular signal transmission. Various microglial surface receptors trigger neuroinflammation, damage neurons, and participate in the development and progression of PND by activating microglia. In this study, the roles of immunoglobulin receptors, chemokine receptors, purinergic receptors, and pattern recognition receptors in microglia surface receptors in PND were reviewed, to provide a reference for the mechanism research, prevention, and treatment of PND.",

Meigs syndrome (MS) is another female-specific disease, defined as a benign ovarian tumor with pleural and ascites effusions, but it is rare and the details of the pathogenesis of MS have not yet been elucidated.A 40-year-old Japanese woman came in with dyspnea. Chest radiography revealed a collapsed right lung. She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which revealed multiple diaphragmatic foramens. She was therefore diagnosed with CP. Later, when she was 50-year-old, returned with chest pain. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen showed right massive pleural effusion and a large tumor and ascites in the pelvis. This condition was suggestive of MS. The patient underwent bilateral oophorectomy, and the right pleural effusion and ascites resolved promptly after surgery.In conclusion, both menstrual-associated CP and MS are very rare conditions, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no reported cases of the combination of the two. However, it is possible that some MS patients may have MS without CP, and the present case is considered to be valuable because a small diaphragmatic foramen was identified via thoracoscopy, which has been a minority opinion among the mechanisms of pleural effusion in MS.",

    "abstract": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy is defined as heart failure secondary to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction <45% occurring towards the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery without other identifiable cause. Pathogenesis of peripartum cardiomyopathy and the role of genetic variants are unknown. We present a previously healthy 33-year-old woman in her first pregnancy with acute onset of heart failure postpartum. She developed cardiogenic shock four days after caesarean section and was treated with levosimendan, cabergoline, ramipril and bisoprolol. She used a wearable cardioverter/defibrillator for 3 months. After 8 months, she was free of symptoms with normal left ventricular function and brain-natriuretic-peptide-levels. Genetic analysis was carried out due to a positive family history and disclosed a heterozygous variant c7627dupA in the <i>TTN</i> gene. Genetic analysis in patients with a positive family history should be carried out since that may provide insights in the pathogenesis of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction including peripartum cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "Game-based learning (GBL) has emerged as a promising approach to engage students and promote deep learning in a variety of educational settings. Neurology and neuroscience are complex fields that require an understanding of intricate neural structures and their functional roles. GBL can support the acquisition and application of such knowledge. In this article, we give an overview of the current state of GBL in neuroscience education. First, we review the language of gaming, establishing conceptual definitions for game elements, gamification, serious games, and GBL. Second, we discuss a literature review of games in the educational literature for adult learners involved in neuroscience. Third, we review available games intended for neuroscience education. Finally, we share tips for educators interested in developing their own educational games. By leveraging the unique features of games, including interactivity, feedback, and immersive experiences, educators and learners can engage with complex neuroscience concepts in a fun, engaging, and effective way.",

However, it can lead to complications such as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), or complications related to the immunosuppressive status of these patients. The role of imaging in this context is essential to help in ICANS diagnosis and to rule out other potential diagnosis, such as central nervous system infections. Two cases are presented to illustrate this clinical problem. CASE 1: describes a 38-year-old patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who developed ICANS after CAR T-cell therapy. MRI revealed signs of leukoencephalopathy. Case 2 involves a 57-year-old patient with mantle-cell lymphoma who presented neurologic symptoms -clinically suggestive of ICANS- after CAR-T therapy. MRI showed signs indicative of limbic encephalitis. These two cases highlight the importance of MRI in clinical practice after CAR T-Cell Therapy underscoring the role of MRI in the diagnosis of complications in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

We described the clinical course of the included cases. A multi-disciplinary panel adjudicated each occurrence of stroke according to a modified classification system for preventability. Fifteen patients experienced a stroke during pregnancy or postpartum. Precisely, 60% presented with a headache, and 47% of events were complicated by severe obstetrical hypertension. Two cases were thought to be \"possibly preventable\" due to delays in presentation to care and miscommunication regarding hypertension management goals. In a cohort of pregnant and postpartum patients with stroke at a tertiary-care center, strokes may be prevented by future initiatives focusing on patient and provider education regarding early warning signs of pregnancy-associated stroke and hypertension thresholds and management specific to pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which is classified as a group 4 pulmonary hypertension (PH), is a life-threatening complication of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). With the introduction of multidisciplinary approaches and innovative treatment strategies for CTEPH, it is currently regarded not as a fatal disease, but as a curable form of PH. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is the preferred imaging method for screening for CTEPH, with superior sensitivity to CT pulmonary angiography. The findings and interpretations of V/Q scan in CTEPH may differ from those observed in acute PE. The use of V/Q scan in combination with SPECT or SPECT/CT is becoming more popular than planar scan alone. Comprehensive understanding of the role of V/Q scan in CTEPH will assist in providing early diagnosis, proper therapeutic decision making, and improved prognosis. This review outlines the current roles and potential clinical applications of V/Q scan in the diagnosis and evaluation of CTEPH.",

    "abstract": "Testing a global null is a canonical problem in statistics and has a wide range of applications. In view of the fact that no uniformly most powerful test exists, prior and/or domain knowledge are commonly used to focus on a certain class of alternatives to improve the testing power. However, it is generally challenging to develop tests that are particularly powerful against a certain class of alternatives. In this paper, motivated by the success of ensemble learning methods for prediction or classification, we propose an ensemble framework for testing that mimics the spirit of random forests to deal with the challenges. Our ensemble testing framework aggregates a collection of weak base tests to form a final ensemble test that maintains strong and robust power for global nulls. We apply the framework to four problems about global testing in different classes of alternatives arising from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) association studies. Specific ensemble tests are proposed for each of these problems, and their theoretical optimality is established in terms of Bahadur efficiency. Extensive simulations and an analysis of a real WGS dataset are conducted to demonstrate the type I error control and/or power gain of the proposed ensemble tests.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) contributes greatly to global cancer incidence and is the main cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. It is a complex disease characterized by numerous subtypes with distinct clinical manifestations. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are not effective in all patients and have been associated with tumor resistance and immunosuppression. Because amino acid (AA)-catabolizing enzymes have been shown to regulate immunosuppressive effects, this review investigated the immunosuppressive roles of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a tryptophan (Trp)-catabolizing enzyme, which is overexpressed in various metastatic tumors. It promotes immunomodulatory effects by depleting Trp in the regional microenvironment. This leads to a reduction in the number of immunogenic immune cells, such as effector T and natural killer (NK) cells, and an increase in tolerogenic immune cells, such as regulatory T (Treg) cells. The BC tumor microenvironment (TME) establishes a supportive niche where cancer cells can interact with immune cells and neighboring endothelial cells and is thus a feasible target for cancer therapy. In many immunological contexts, IDO1 regulates immune control by causing regional metabolic changes in the TME and tissue environment, which may further affect the maturation of systemic immunological tolerance. In the development of effective treatment targets and approaches, it is essential to understand the immunomodulatory effects exerted by AA-catabolizing enzymes, such as IDO1, on the components of the TME.",

    "abstract": "Stress is widely recognized as a major contributor to a variety of health issues. Stress prediction using biosignal data recorded by wearables is a key area of study in mobile sensing research because real-time stress prediction can enable digital interventions to immediately react at the onset of stress, helping to avoid many psychological and physiological symptoms such as heart rhythm irregularities. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is often used to measure stress. However, major challenges with the prediction of stress using machine learning include the subjectivity and sparseness of the labels, a large feature space, relatively few labels, and a complex nonlinear and subjective relationship between the features and outcomes. To tackle these issues, we examined the use of model personalization: training a separate stress prediction model for each user. To allow the neural network to learn the temporal dynamics of each individual's baseline biosignal patterns, thus enabling personalization with very few labels, we pre-trained a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) using self-supervised learning (SSL). We evaluated our method using the Wearable Stress and Affect Detection(WESAD) dataset. We fine-tuned the pre-trained networks to the stress-prediction task and compared against equivalent models without any self-supervised pre-training. We discovered that embeddings learned using our pre-training method outperformed the supervised baselines with significantly fewer labeled data points: the models trained with SSL required less than 30% of the labels to reach equivalent performance without personalized SSL. This personalized learning method can enable precision health systems that are tailored to each subject and require few annotations by the end user, thus allowing for the mobile sensing of increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and subjective outcomes such as stress.",

    "abstract": "5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is used during resection of malignant gliomas due to its fluorescence properties and has been shown to render resection more effective than resection without ALA guidance. The aim of this narrative review is to categorize the adverse effects of ALA relevant to anesthesia providers. Intraoperative hypotension, porphyria-related side effects, alterations in blood chemistry and coagulation, photosensitivity, and increased levels of liver enzymes have all been reported. We also sought to examine the impact of dosage and timing of oral administration on efficacy of ALA and on these side effects. Twenty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria of patients undergoing craniotomy for glioma resection using ALA and occurrence of at least one adverse effect. The results of these studies showed that there was heterogeneity in levels of intraoperative hypotension, with some reporting an incidence as high as 32%, and that hypotension was associated with antihypertensive medication use. Clinical symptoms of porphyria, such as gastrointestinal disturbance, were less commonly reported. Photosensitivity of the skin after 5-ALA administration was well documented particularly in patients exposed to light; however, adverse effects on the eye were not adequately studied. Elevation in liver enzymes was a common finding postoperatively but was often clinically insignificant. The timing of oral administration presents practical issues for the preoperative management of patients undergoing resection with ALA. We provide guidance for perioperative management of patients who receive ALA for brain tumor resection. Controlled studies with adequate statistical power are required to further understand and prevent the adverse effects of ALA.",

To introduce a supplementary graft to support the cartilaginous framework. Forty patients (37 female and 3 male), aged from 18 to 40 years (average 29), received a rhinoplasty using a spacer graft. Of these, 12 were primary cases and the other 28 had a previous rhinoplasty procedure. Postoperatively, all patients were photographed and asked to complete a satisfaction survey. Complications were collected retrospectively. Postoperatively, the mean nasofrontal angle was 141.92±1.26 degrees for the primary cases and 140.75±2.22 degrees for the repeat procedures; the mean nasolabial angle was 88.69±0.95 degrees for primary cases and 89.14±0.93 degrees for the repeat procedures; mean nasal length was 4.78±0.05 cm for primary cases and 4.79±0.07 cm for the repeat procedures; mean tip projection was 4.68±6.35 cm for primary cases and 2.24±0.07 cm for the repeat procedures. Self-report of the overall improvements showed a high satisfaction rate. One case (2.5%) had a postoperative complication involving a mildly deviated columellar. The spacer graft can be used as an effective supplement to the traditional methods for reconstructing the nasal tip framework; it can prevent the occurrence of postoperative complications such as the exposure of the nasal prosthesis, the downward rotation of the nasal tip, the depression of the supratip regions of the nose, and the deviation of the nasal columella.",

Surgical resection is the first-line treatment; however, no clear standard of care has been clearly established because of the rarity of these tumors. A 61-year-old man who had presented with dyspnea on exertion was referred to our hospital. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed massive pericardial effusion and a 40-mm enhanced mass adherent to the anterior wall of the right atrium and involving the right coronary artery. Having diagnosed the mass as a cardiac tumor, we resected the mass under the guidance of epi-cardiac echocardiography guidance, which showed continuity between the tumor and the right atrium, reconstructed the right atrial free wall with a bovine pericardial patch, and performed coronary artery bypass grafting to the right coronary artery using the great saphenous vein. The right atrial wall was resected with adequate tumor-free margin. On the right ventricular side, we resected the right atrial wall 1 cm from the tumor, 2 cm from the atrioventricular groove. Because hemodynamic deterioration occurred after aortic declamping, intra-aortic balloon pumping and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were instituted. Postoperatively, circulatory support devices were removed safely, and the patient was discharged on the 25th postoperative day. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimens resulted in a diagnosis of angiosarcoma, with positive surgical margins. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy (69 Gy in 30 fractions) were therefore initiated after discharge. To date, the patient has been alive and well with no recurrence of tumor for 4 years and 10 months since surgery. This case study suggests the usefulness of multimodality treatment comprising surgical resection and adjuvant therapy, for cardiac angiosarcoma.",

    "abstract": "Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lassueur syndrome (GLPLS) is a type of lichen planopilaris. It mainly affects females aged 40-60 years. It is characterized by the triad of patchy cicatricial alopecia of the scalp, noncicatricial alopecia of the axilla and groin and a follicular spinous papule on the body, scalp, or both. The diagnosis is based on clinicopathological correlation. Different modalities of treatment are available with unsatisfactory responses, so early diagnosis is necessary to prevent progression and scarring alopecia. A case of GLPLS with classical features on clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathological examination is presented in a 73-year-old female.",

We aim to describe a validated workflow for an in-house 3D Printing Department within a level III University Hospital of the Spanish Public Health System using free software. Our study outlines a cost-effective and time-efficient workflow utilizing free software for 3D printing. We assess the feasibility of establishing an in-house department compared to outsourcing to the biomedical industry. The study demonstrates that creating an in-house 3D Printing Department in a hospital setting is a viable option. We discuss the advantages, including cost savings and reduced lead times, as well as the limitations of this approach. In conclusion, establishing an in-house 3D Printing Department has the potential to significantly streamline complex head and neck oncologic surgery procedures. This approach can enhance accessibility to advanced CAD/CAM, making them more efficient and cost-effective within the healthcare system.",

It is a known mandibular reconstruction option in children, and though poorly understood and unpredictable, the concerns of developmental changes to donor and recipient tissues shared by other treatment options are nonexistent. The definitive role of periosteum during bone regeneration remains largely unknown. The objective is to review the literature on the clinical and molecular mechanism evidence of this event. Our search methodology was modeled after the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. Search strategies were categorized into search 1 for clinical evidence of mandibular regeneration and search 2 for gene expression review for craniofacial regeneration. The quality assessment of each publication was undertaken, and inclusion criteria comprise mandibular continuity defect for search 1 and use of gene expression assay propriety kit for search 2. 33 studies were selected for search 1 while four studies with non-human subjects were selected for search 2. Monitoring of PMBR onset was advised at 2 weeks post-operative, and the gene expression results showed an upregulation of genes responsible for angiogenesis, cytokine activities, and immune-inflammatory response in week 1 and skeletal development and signaling pathways in week 2. The results suggest that young periosteum has a higher probability of PMBR than adult periosteum, and skeletal morphogenesis regulated by skeletal developmental genes and pathways may characterize the gene expression patterns of PMBR.",

    "title": "Generating Realistic and Representative Trajectories with Mobility Behavior Clustering.",
    "abstract": "Accessing realistic human movements (aka trajectories) is essential for many application domains, such as urban planning, transportation, and public health. However, due to privacy and commercial concerns, real-world trajectories are not readily available, giving rise to an important research area of generating synthetic but realistic trajectories. Inspired by the success of deep neural networks (DNN), data-driven methods learn the underlying human decision-making mechanisms and generate synthetic trajectories by directly fitting real-world data. However, these DNN-based approaches do not exploit people's moving behaviors (e.g., work commute, shopping purpose), significantly influencing human decisions during the generation process. This paper proposes MBP-GAIL, a novel framework based on generative adversarial imitation learning that synthesizes realistic trajectories that preserve moving behavior patterns in real data. MBP-GAIL models temporal dependencies by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and combines the stochastic constraints from moving behavior patterns and spatial constraints in the learning process. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that MBP-GAIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can better support decision making in trajectory simulations.",

    "abstract": "Optical vortices (OVs), as eigenmodes of optical orbital angular momentum, have been widely used in particle micro-manipulation. Recently, perfect optical vortices (POVs), a subclass of OVs, are gaining increasing interest and becoming an indispensable tool in optical trapping due to their unique property of topological charge-independent vortex radius. Here, we expand the concept of POVs by proposing concentric ring optical traps (CROTs) and apply them to trapping and rotating particles. A CROT consists of a series of concentric rings, each being a vortex whose radius and topological charge can be controlled independently with respect to the other rings. Quantitative results show that the generated CROTs have weak sidelobes, good uniformity, and relatively high diffraction efficiency. In experiments, CROTs are observed to trap multiple dielectric particles simultaneously on different rings and rotate these particles with the direction and speed of rotation depending on the topological charge sign and value of each individual ring. In addition, gold particles are observed to be trapped and rotate in the dark region between two bright rings. As a novel tool, CROTs may find potential applications in fields like optical manipulation and microfluidic viscosity measurements.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma, characterized by its damage to the retinal nerve, is one of the most statistically dominant eye diseases in the U.S. It can cause vision loss and blindness by affecting the optic nerve. As the disease progresses, it is not necessarily noticeable to patients, requiring elaborate solutions to manage this critical condition. In this paper, we propose a novel detection model that provides improved accuracy and performance in the detection of glaucoma using retinographies as input. After careful consideration, we adopted multiple features suitable for distinguishing healthy and diseased eyes. Moreover, the adoption, integration, and feature extraction of 3D meshes was a significant factor in developing our glaucoma detection system. With our acquired dataset, we compared the performance of Classification Decision Trees (CDT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) in classifying retinographies as being healthy or having glaucoma. Experimental results show that the proposed model methodology can efficiently predict glaucoma detection with 100%, 100%, and 83.3% accuracy from CDT, SVM, and KNN, respectively.",

Clinicians and institutions providing FP services should ensure that they are aware of the needs and circumstances of this underrepresented group of patients and offer them accurate and evidence-based information when counseling and tailoring their FP treatment. <b><i>Materials and methods:</i></b> For this scoping review, three major search engines were used. Including Embase, Epistemonikos, Google Scholar, MEDLINE and PubMed. Sources of grey literature were also explored (ResearchGate and Web of Science). The combination of only two keywords [transgender] AND [fertility preservation] was used up to May 2023. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The available evidence on clinical management and FP outcomes in transgender patients is limited and mainly originates from case reports or small case series. The main limitation of current FP services for transgender and non-binary individuals is the lack of scientific evidence regarding their care. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> Overall, FP in transgender patients requires individualized and realistic plans, and psychological counseling should be offered. This review aims to provide the latest evidence coming from original studies to facilitate proper counseling and fertility management for these individuals. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Inclusive health systems that provide comprehensive reproductive health care to transgender individuals can help them make informed decisions about FP and improve their quality of life. Future research is needed to establish more robust evidence-based guidelines for the management of transgender and non-binary individuals in the FP setting.",

If GSRs are covered with bloodstains, SEM cannot detect them. In this study, an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method is proposed to solve this problem. Results show that bloodstains did not interfere with GSRs and low-level elements are detected. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of Sn, Sb, Ba, and Pb elements in GSRs are also carried out. Different pretreatment methods are adopted according to the characteristics of different samples. Our investigations suggest that the proposed method has the advantages of low detection limit and high sensitivity and it can be very important in expert testimony. GSRs with bloodstains could be successfully detected <i>via</i> ICP-MS and bloodstains did not interfere in GSRs analysis.The best pretreatment method for incident bullet holes with bloodstains was microwave digestion.The best pretreatment method for the region around the bullet hole and the shooter's hand with bloodstains was ultrasonic vibration.For the same shooting distance, GSRs collected from the cloth and the shooter's hand with type 95-1 rifle were higher than that of type 92 pistol.",

Unilateral PA is often associated with other congenital anomalies, whereas bilateral PA is fatal. Prenatal diagnosis is rare and is diagnosed more frequently in the postnatal period than in the prenatal period. Is a challenge that may be difficult as it shares similar features with other more common pathologies. Ultrasound plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and management. Ultrasonographic findings for a correct prenatal diagnosis include mediastinum displacement with the absence of parenchymal or cystic tissue, decreased thoracic volume, an elevated diaphragm, cardiac axis deviation, and a hemithoracic cavity largely occupied by the heart. Cases of right PA have a worse prognosis compared to left PA, probably due to higher frequency of cardiac and great vessel abnormalities. A rare case of early prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of unilateral fetal PA, at 18 weeks of gestation, is reported.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present report was to provide an overview of the use of the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) in adult females with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) over the past 50 years. A literature search was conducted in December 2022 and January 2023 using the MEDLINE and Embase databases, screening for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective series and reviews on AUS. Only articles published in English or French were included. The search strategy involved a free text protocol and the narrative review reporting checklist was completed. The AUS is a device used over the past 50 years for SUI caused by intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD). It has the theoretical ability to simulate the function of a biological urinary sphincter. Although the role of the AUS for females with ISD remains heterogeneous from one part of the world to the other, the existing literature demonstrates that AUS yields satisfactory functional outcomes in female SUI patients, comparable or better to what has been reported in male AUS series. Hence, the main barrier to its adoption has so far been the technical challenge of its implantation at the bladder neck. Regarding the results of AUS implantation in females, we included in this review 3 reviews, retrospective studies and 1 prospective study. In recent years, robotic techniques of female AUS implantation have spread significantly with promising outcomes including numerous reports suggesting that it may decrease its morbidity. In the near future, the development of electromechanical devices may further expand the role of AUS in the management of female SUI. While the use of AUS in female patients provides excellent functional outcomes, it has been limited to scarce centers. However, due to the rise of minimally invasive approaches, it has started spreading again over the past few years. The future of AUS is likely to be bright, fed by technological advances of the device and robotic surgical system, high level of evidence studies and joint efforts of the urological community to facilitate its diffusion across the world.",

However, it is difficult to demonstrate the medical necessity of FGAS in terms of postoperative quality of life (QoL) outcomes due to a lack of standardized assessment tools. Thus, FGAS remains largely unsubsidized in North America. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A systematic review of online databases was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Screening and quality assessment was conducted by two independent blinded reviewers (KJ and GR). For statistical analysis, data from different Likert-scale-like questionnaires were extracted and coalesced into three-point scales on a data table of seven QoL domains; \"Pre-\" and \"Postoperative femininity,\" \"Psychological satisfaction,\" \"Social Integration and Functioning,\" \"Aesthetic Satisfaction,\" \"Physical Health,\" and \"Satisfaction with Surgical Results.\" <b><i>Results:</i></b> From 2000 to 2022, 1837 patients and 3886 procedures from 19 studies were included. Weighted averages across all QoL domains reflected statistically significant improvement compared to neutral following FGAS (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Three studies used the same questionnaire, which showed that out of all eight questions regarding facial appearance, FGAS patients most strongly agreed the surgery was important to their ability to live as a woman (mean = 4.56/5, <i>n</i> = 137). Secondary outcomes showed the most common complications were hardware palpability (3.45%, <i>n</i> = 145) and aberrant scarring (2.17%, <i>n</i> = 423) with an overall revision rate of 2.17% (<i>n</i> = 423). The most common procedure was fronto-orbital remodeling. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> FGAS significantly improves QoL with minimal risk to life and supports the literature in defining FGAS as a medically necessary procedure comparable to other TRSs.",

Burgeoning research literatures have aimed to understand how people achieve task focus and task switch readiness. In this Perspective, I integrate these literatures to derive a cognitive architecture and functional rules underlying the regulation of cognitive stability and flexibility. I propose that task focus and task switch readiness are supported by independent mechanisms. However, I also suggest that the strategic regulation of both mechanisms is governed by shared learning principles: an incremental, online learner that nudges control up or down based on the recent history of task demands (a recency heuristic) and episodic reinstatement when the current context matches a past experience (a recognition heuristic). Finally, I discuss algorithmic and neural implementations of these processes, as well as clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Amadori compounds (ACs) are key intermediates of the Maillard reaction, and found in various thermally processed foods. Simultaneous analysis of multiple ACs is challenging due to the complex amino acid and carbohydrate compositions, and the different food matrices. Most studies focus on the effects of ACs on food flavor and related sensory properties, but not their biological functions. However, increasing evidence shows that ACs possess various beneficial effects on human health, thus a comprehensive review on the various biological activities is warranted. In this review, we summarized the composition and content of ACs in different foods, their formation and degradation reactions, and discussed the latest advances in analytical methods of ACs and their biological functions related to human health. Limitations and research gaps were identified and future perspectives on ACs research were proposed. This review points to the needs of systematic and comprehensive <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies on human health related biological functions of ACs and their mechanisms of action, particularly the synergistic effects with other food components and drugs, and roles in intestinal health and metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "Improving potential strategies for biological activities of phlorotannins derived from seaweeds.",
    "abstract": "Seaweeds have garnered considerable attention due to their capacity to serve as exceptional reservoirs of numerous bioactive metabolites possessing substantial chemical and biological significance. .Phlorotannins constitute a significant class of natural polyphenols originating from brown seaweeds, featuring a broad spectrum of bioactive attributes and demonstrating potential applicability across various sectors. The potential health advantages associated with phlorotannins, particularly concerning the prevention of conditions linked to oxidative stress, such as inflammation, diabetes, and allergies, have generated substantial interest within the food and pharmaceutical industries. Nevertheless, current research remains insufficient in providing a comprehensive understanding of their absorption, as comparisons drawn with their terrestrial counterparts remain speculative. It is commonly presumed that phenolic compounds, including phlorotannins, face challenges due to their limited solubility, instability, and extensive metabolism, all of which restrict their bioavailability. In order to circumvent these limitations and amplify their utility as components of medicinal formulations or healthcare products, researchers have explored various strategies, including the encapsulation or integration of phlorotannins into nano-/micro-particles or advanced drug delivery systems. This review offers a thorough exploration of the structural and biological attributes of phlorotannins and furnishes insights into potential strategies showing promise for their effective utilization in preclinical and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Radial forearm free flaps (RFFF) are a versatile option for the reconstruction of a wide variety of soft tissue defects and are particularly common in head and neck surgery. Benefits of RFFF include a relatively short operating time, a long pedicle, and a thinner, more pliable flap. However, in addition to its role in reconstructive surgery, the radial artery may be utilized for a number of other procedures including coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions. Concern has previously been raised that prior catheterization may deleteriously affect the function of the radial artery and in the field of cardiothoracic surgery, individuals are increasingly advising against its use as a graft for coronary artery bypass graft surgery in such circumstances. Despite this, little is known about the effect on RFFF. In this review article, we concisely consider the available evidence of the effect of previous transradial catheterization on the radial artery and discuss the implications for reconstructive surgery. We then summarize the key considerations regarding their use in current practice.",

The incidence of HAIs in COVID-19 hospitalized patients has been addressed in systematic reviews, but in these there was no description of mortality related to these infections. Therefore, the aim of this review was to evaluate the impact of HAIs on mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, specially by multidrug resistant bacteria as Acinetobacter baumannii. A systematic review was carried out in the PubMed database on July 2022 using the keywords \"healthcare-associated infection\" OR \"nosocomial infection\" AND \"COVID-19\" AND \"Acinetobacter baumannii\". The incidence of HAIs in COVID-19 patients was 18.85%, with 42.17% of mortality rate and relative risk (RR) 2.08 (95%CI 1.61-2.68). Considering that the risk of death was twice greater in co-infection COVID-19/HAI, it is essential the broad vaccination against COVID-19 and the adoption of measures to reduce HAI incidence in hospitalized patients and mortality by superinfections.",

Common experiences in coping with rare diseases were observed, similar to those referred to globally, perpetuating the vicious circle between specialties, obtaining a diagnosis, post-diagnostic therapies, lack of qualified information and dissemination of knowledge. Arrival at the rare disease reference service revealed a new meaning, based on trust in therapeutic relationships and diagnostic chances, however there was an absence and discontinuity in the provision of some specialties and multidisciplinary therapies. on a continuous basis, providing opportunities in an equal manner. In addition to the need for coordination of care, it was evident that the responsibility for coping with illness is primarily exercised by women, who assume responsibility for the daily therapeutic activities and care of their children. The role of primary care in timely referral and coordination of care in the care network was reaffirmed, promoting equal access and alleviating the burden of management borne by families, which goes beyond and overloads their journey, especially for women.",

    "abstract": "This review investigated current research on the relationship between chronic pain and cognitive performance, subjective cognitive decline, and dementia. In addition, we reviewed current research on pain management in older adults across the cognitive trajectory. Chronic pain remains a common problem in older adults. A new, international classification system highlights the complexity of chronic pain syndromes. Research supports relationships between chronic pain and changes in cognitive performance in generally healthy adults. Evidence also supports associations between pain and subjective cognitive decline, which is considered a possible precursor to dementia. The impact of dementia on pain expression is also reviewed. To manage pain in older adults, we present a multimodal pain management hierarchy that includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. To avoid the risks and side effects of analgesics, non-pharmacological treatment is recommended as the first line therapy for chronic pain. Medical cannabis and music therapy are two non-pharmacological treatments that have been the focus of substantial recent research; evidence supports their effectiveness in reducing pain and both strategies warrant further investigation. Chronic pain is associated with different levels of cognitive decline across the cognitive trajectory. Medical cannabis and music therapy are the two emerging non-pharmacological treatment methods. Clinical studies with rigorous research design are needed to further investigate the effects of these two strategies on pain relief in older adults.",

We included 50 patients with recurrent cheilitis (reversible cheilitis) who were dermatologically examined and agreed to undergo allergy skin tests, i.e., patch test and prick test. Additionally, clinical pictures and patient mental stress levels were examined using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Positive prick tests (atopy) were recorded in 84% of patients with cheilitis. The most frequently found allergens were contact allergens (54%) (cobalt chloride, nickel sulfate and thimerosal) and inhalant allergens (46%). The patch test positive subjects who used cosmetic, hygiene, and decorative products were significantly more likely to have swollen and red lips than the patch test negative subjects. Also, low stress levels were recorded less frequently in patients with confirmed allergies than in non-allergic patients. The results indicated a higher incidence of cheilitis in the people prone to allergies (atopics) and confirmed an association between cheilitis and allergies. To our knowledge, this is the first study in patients with cheilitis, which simultaneously analyzed allergies, their clinical features and PSS in the same patients.",

Examination revealed a diffusely swollen glottis, paralyzed vocal cords, and post-radiation fibrosis. Several glottic biopsies yielded results negative for malignancy and favored radiation-induced changes. When presented with the option of further diagnostic testing with a positron emission tomography (PET) scan or an outright laryngectomy, the patient decided on the latter. Final histopathologic diagnosis was negative for recurrence of malignancy. This case demonstrates treatment dilemmas for patients with laryngeal carcinoma with uncertain recurrence wherein radical surgical management may prove to be a viable option to achieve both diagnostic certainty and ultimate relief of symptoms.",

In Brazil, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is also highly prevalent, and it is associated with metabolic and cardiovascular impacts, excessive daytime sleepiness, and increasing risk of traffic accidents. Laboratory-based polysomnography is the gold standard test for OSA diagnosis. However, its complexity has led to the search for alternatives to simplify the diagnosis, such as the out-of-center sleep test (OCST). <b>Objectives</b>  To discusses the minimum OCST recording time and the potential effects of the supine position on this parameter. <b>Data Synthesis</b>  We conducted a search on the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases to identify relevant studies on OCST recording time and a possible association with body position. We used a combination of terms, including <i>Obstructive Sleep Apnea</i> and <i>Home Monitoring</i> OR <i>Home Care Services</i> OR <i>Portable Monitoring</i> AND <i>Supine</i> OR <i>Position</i> OR <i>Recording Time</i> OR <i>Positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea</i> . The references of the selected articles were also reviewed to find other relevant studies. Through our approach, eighteen articles were retrieved and included in the present study. <b>Conclusion</b>  Since OCSTs are conducted in an unattended environment, with potential signal loss during the night, it is crucial to determine the minimum recording time to validate the test and assess how the time spent in the supine position affects this parameter. After reviewing the literature, this topic remains to be clarified, and additional studies should focus on that matter.",

In addition, limited access along with poor visibility and difficulty to isolate or ligate adds to the problem of bleeding during surgery. As a result, to counter drawbacks of intraoperative bleeding, method of induced hypotension stands out. Hypotensive anesthesia is a method through which blood pressure is decreased in a controlled manner. Various studies have been conducted that compared multiple methods to reduce intraoperative blood loss and improve visibility of surgical field. Hence, need for a systematic review to study the effects of hypotensive anesthesia on intraoperative blood loss, duration of the surgery and quality of surgical field. An electronic search was conducted to cumulate data from PubMed, Google scholar and institutional library from 2000 to 2020. In addition, bibliographies of included studies were hand searched to identify potentially eligible studies to append to the data and reach a conclusion. Comparative study of the data available indicates that controlled hypotension during general anesthesia is safe for young healthy patients undergoing orthognathic surgeries. This information could be of key importance to aid in reducing intraoperative blood loss and which improves the observability of the surgical field; lessen the chances of need for blood transfusion; and eventually shorten the length of stay in hospital.",

    "abstract": "With the flourishing development of precision medicine, theranostics, generally recognized as the integration of diagnosis and treatment, has emerged as a prominent trend in clinical research. However, theranostics primarily emphasizes the end result of integration, without providing sufficient details on how precise diagnosis and synergetic individualized treatment could be achieved and what clinical challenges could be effectively addressed in clinical practice. Molecular probe technology provides a robust method to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Through meticulous design of the chemical structure, imaging labels or drugs were conjugated to tumor-targeting peptides, antibodies, or inducers to form molecular probes, which allow a seamless switch between targeted intervention and targeted imaging with consistency in time, space, and biodistribution. Thus, this review proposes a concept called \"molecular eye\", which refers to a comprehensive system for precise diagnosis and treatment of major clinical diseases based on molecular probe technology. This medical system emphasizes the chemical basis of probe development and optimization, which can provide precise actionable information for clinical decision making, allow molecular-targeted therapy, expand the indications of old therapy, and accelerate the regulatory approval of molecular drugs. \"Molecular eye\" resembles the piercing eye of the Monkey King, which can detect previously \"invisible\" diseases and facilitate disease diagnosis, treatment, real-time evaluation, and pathology research, guiding drug development. The emergence of the \"molecular eyes\" will provide opportunities and challenges in the fields of clinical practice and medical research and propel the progression of contemporary medicine toward precision medicine.",

However, it has been recognized that attempts to forge peace have a longer timeline, involving the interplay of several national and international historical contexts in which the European Community (EC) / European Union (EU) dimension and the role of the EU institutions in restoring peace and reconciliation has been generally neglected. The objective of this article is therefore to examine the European dimension of the Northern Ireland talks process, addressing the whole range of relationships affecting the political stalemate in the years preceding the signing of Belfast/Good Friday Agreement (GFA). Drawing on never-before-seen United Kingdom (UK) government and EC/EU archival documents and semi-structured élite interviews, this article highlights how the original dialogue on power-sharing and devolution in Northern Ireland included a much stronger EU dimension that it is publicly acknowledged. This article constitutes an emblematic case-study on the 'Europeanisation' of British politics in Northern Ireland, with findings uncovering a new and subtle dimension of the EC/EU role in the Northern Ireland peace process.",

A Mannich-type reaction between quinazolin-4-ones and <i>N</i>-Cbz propanal in the presence of AgOTf afforded quinazolinones (19-94% isolated yield) bearing a newly formed heterocycle with an alkylamine appendage that, upon <i>N</i>-Cbz deprotection and basification, triggered a domino rearrangement to afford 45 separable, ring-fused products.

    "abstract": "Emotional labor may be vital to the success of qualitative research studies, particularly longitudinal studies that depend on the maintenance of research relationships over time. Rather than being limited to the comportment of researchers toward their participants, however, we find that participants also actively engage in practices of emotional labor to manage researchers and guide research interactions. We document elements of such \"mutual emotional labor\" in the establishment of rapport, in crafting experiences of personalized therapeutic benefit from participating in interviews, and in efforts to navigate closure at the conclusion of research projects. We argue that by recognizing forms of reciprocal emotion management, researchers may be better equipped to engage in ethical research practices that serve not only knowledge production but also human connection and care.",

    "abstract": "18F-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET is fast becoming the gold-standard in prostate cancer, both in staging of intermediate-/high-risk patients and in re-staging patients with biochemical failure. Several pitfalls of 18F-PSMA PET have been reported, and we report, to our best of knowledge, for the first time, a case which could have been falsely diagnosed as peritoneal spread. A 67-year-old patient with high-risk prostate cancer underwent staging with 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT (PSMA-PET/CT). PSMA-PET/CT revealed a histologically confirmed prostatic malignancy in the peripheral left zone. Unexpectedly, additional multiple highly PSMA-expressing intraabdominal formations were discovered. Based on apparent anatomic asplenia and a history of traumatic splenic rapture during childhood, a suspicion of post-traumatic splenosis was raised. For further non-invasive evaluation, a C-99 sulphur colloid scintigraphy with SPECT was conducted, confirming the presence of multiple functional ectopic splenic tissues. This is, to our best of knowledge, the first case utilising 18F-PSMA-1007-PET/CT and 99mTc-sulphur colloid SPECT to detect intraabdominal splenosis, highlighting the high potential of nuclear medicine in such trivial cases.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the Attlee government's performance as a crisis manager in relation to tobacco policy in the years prior to the publication in 1950 of research linking smoking and cancer. Health concerns played no role in tobacco policy before 1950, and the government hoped more teenagers would take up smoking and pay tobacco duty. Tobacco took on added significance as an economic issue because policy-makers had so little room for manoeuvre. Their task was to balance the desire of consumers to smoke as much as they liked at a reasonable price, the exchequer's need to raise revenue from tobacco duties, and the imperative to conserve scarce dollars. Tobacco was an economic and financial rather than a health issue in the late 1940s and the authorities juggled competing demands creditably. This article examines previously neglected but important aspects of the histories of tobacco and of the Attlee government's economic policies.",

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Misgendering-using the wrong name, pronoun, or gendered language to refer to someone-is known to have negative impacts on the mental health and well-being of trans individuals generally. However, little is known about the effects of misgendering on nonbinary people specifically. <b>Aims:</b> As such, our research asked: 1) Among nonbinary people, what factors are associated with frequency of misgendering?; and 2) Do nonbinary people who experience misgendering less often have better health outcomes? <b>Methods and Results:</b> We analyzed data from Trans PULSE Canada, a community-based survey of trans and nonbinary people living in Canada, using a subset (<i>n</i> = 1091) who identified as nonbinary and completed questions on misgendering. Misgendering was a frequent and distressing experience for nonbinary participants, with 59% misgendered daily, 30% weekly or monthly, and only 11% yearly or less. Most (58%) reported being very or quite upset when misgendered. About one in eight (13%) corrected others most or all of the times they were misgendered. Daily misgendering was more common among nonbinary people who were younger than 25 years old (64%, <i>p</i> < .0001), visibly disabled (74%, <i>p</i> = .003), assigned female at birth (61%, <i>p</i> <.0001) or racialized as a person of color and assigned male at birth (65%, <i>p</i> < .0001) compared with their counterparts. In multivariable regression analyses, less frequent misgendering (weekly/monthly vs. daily) was associated with a lower OASIS anxiety score (β = -0.555, 95% CI = -1.062, -0.048). <b>Discussion:</b> Our research highlights the complexity of outness, passing, concealment, and affirmation for nonbinary people living at the intersections of marginalizations. Future research could build stronger causal analyses of the impacts of misgendering, how nonbinary people cope with misgendering, and policy and interventions to decrease misgendering.",

    "abstract": "The disposal of faecal sludge from non-networked sanitation amenities leads to contamination of the surrounding environment and increasing public health problems across developing countries. Permanent solutions to deal with faecal sludge are required to solve the sanitation crisis and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 \"ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\" by 2030. Full-scale pyrolysis of faecal sludge in developing countries is fast becoming a safe and long-term option. Pyrolysis not only eliminates pathogens within the sludge but produces biochar as an end product which has the potential as a soil amendment to increase crop yield. In general, faecal sludge biochars have high pH values, high ash contents, and high macro-and micronutrient concentrations. Compared to biochar from lignocellulosic materials, faecal sludge biochar contains less carbon and exhibits lower porosities, and lower surface areas. However, evaluating the properties of faecal sludge biochar is difficult due to the different technologies used in collection, storage, and transportation of the feedstock. Differences in faecal sludge characteristics based on location, climate, age of the sludge, type of sanitation technology and seasonality are also factors in determining the properties of faecal sludge biochars. These factors contribute to the difficulty in describing faecal sludge biochar properties in general terms, and there is an argument to be made that characteristics of large-scale faecal sludge biochar should be determined on a case-by-case basis. The conclusion of this review is that future research should concentrate on short-term and long-term field studies of faecal sludge biochar application to different soil types.",

Together with adhering to safety protocols, vaccines are needed to help decrease the mortality and morbidity. As with any other, COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated based on efficacy and safety. Real world data is important in the recommendation of vaccines. This study aims to assess the short-term safety of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines administered to Filipino adolescents from October 15, 2021 to December 15, 2021 at the Philippine General Hospital. The number and type of local and systemic reaction within 7 days of vaccination were determined. This is a retrospective cohort study. The review of the recorded events was done through an electronic diary that was accessed from the official Electronic Medical Records of University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH). This included solicited and prespecified local and systemic reactions that occurred within 7 days of receipt of vaccine dose. Descriptive statistics was used to present the data. Out of the 1,756 BNT162b2 vaccines administered (Dose 1 - 890; Dose 2 - 866), 13% (N=221) indicated having adverse reaction. Injection site pain was the overall most common reaction with majority (81%) experiencing it within 7 days of vaccination. Systemic reactions made up 60% of the reactions after Dose 1 and 85% of the reactions after Dose 2. This includes tiredness, headache and fever. None of the reactions required hospitalization or further workup. BNT162b2 vaccine has a good safety profile among adolescents vaccinated at UP-PGH, since most of the reported adverse events within 7 days of vaccination were local and systemic reactogenic reactions that did not necessitate hospitalization or work-up. No serious adverse events were reported. Further follow-up is suggested to assess longer term safety.",

Device-independent (DI) QSDC guarantees the message security relying only on the observation of the Bell-inequality violation, but not on any detailed description or trust of the devices' inner workings.

To increase DI-QSDC's secret messages capacity, we propose a high-capacity DI-QSDC protocol based on the hyper-encoding technique. The total message leakage rate of our DI-QSDC protocol only relies on the most robust degree of freedom. We provide the numerical simulation of its secret message capacity altered with the communication distance. Our work serves as an important step toward the further development of DI-QSDC systems.",

Further, semantic integration of incongruent objects elicits a stronger N300/N400 EEG component. Yet, the time course and mechanisms of how contextual information supports access to semantic object information is unclear. We used computational modelling and EEG to test how context influences semantic object processing. Using representational similarity analysis, we established that EEG patterns dissociated between objects in congruent or incongruent scenes from around 300 ms. By modelling the semantic processing of objects using independently normed properties, we confirm that the onset of semantic processing of both congruent and incongruent objects is similar (~150 ms). Critically, after ~275 ms, we discover a difference in the duration of semantic integration, lasting longer for incongruent compared to congruent objects. These results constrain our understanding of how contextual information supports access to semantic object information.",

PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to March 2022 for studies involving the measurement of condylar positional changes after surgical treatment of Class III dentofacial deformity in adults with BSSO without or without Le Fort I osteotomies. The methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) was utilized to assess the risk of bias and quality of non-randomized studies. Reporting of this review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Primary outcome was condyle positional changes between the following time points: T0: before treatment, T1: immediately post treatment, T2: 4, 6, or 9 months post treatment, T3: one year post treatment. Nineteen studies were included in the systematic review. Eleven studies were deemed low quality, and the rest were of medium quality. The meta-analysis included 12 studies and showed statistically significant downward, outward positional changes at T1(Immediately after surgery). Inward Yaw rotation was significant at T1(1-4 month post-surgery) and T2(4-9 months post-surgery). Surgically induced condylar changes tend to go back to normal within the first year after surgery, except for condylar yaw rotations.",

    "abstract": "While benefitting from neuroradiologists' reports, neurologists use their own image interpretation to guide clinical decisions, especially in acute care settings. This calls for robust neuroradiology training in neurology residency, informed by current educational gaps and practices. This study aims to (1) characterize the formal neuroradiology curriculum among Canadian neurology residency programs; (2) assess neurology residents' neuroimaging interpretation competencies; and (3) define neurology residents' and program directors' (PDs) attitudes toward the current curriculum and future directions. Anonymous surveys were sent to Canadian neurology residents and PDs, querying neuroradiology learning activities, imaging modalities covered, assessment modalities, perceived residents' competencies to interpret different modalities, and attitudes regarding neuroradiology training. Residents were asked to interpret 15 neuroimaging cases. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed. Potential differences in residents' interpretation success rates by seniority, self-perceived proficiency, and perception of curriculum sufficiency were examined using 2-tailed Welch tests with a 95% CI and Holm-Bonferroni comparison adjustment. Statistics were computed using Excel. Seventy-eight (32.6%) residents and 11 (68.8%) PDs participated. Ten of 11 PDs reported including a mandatory neuroradiology rotation, and 9/11 offered a formal neuroradiology curriculum covering head CT, head and neck CT angiography (CTA), spine MRI, and head MRI. Programs predominantly offered additional didactic lectures (9/11), teaching cases (8/11), and imaging websites (8/11). Most of the residents agreed with a minimum 1-month long rotation and desired regular didactics from neuroradiologists. Residents favored learning about head MRI (88.5%), head and neck CTA (76.9%), and spine MRI (69.2%). Senior residents' self-perceived competencies were highest for head CT, head MRI, and head and neck CTA, but lower than PDs' perception. Senior residents had greater interpretation scores than juniors (84.5% ± 13.2% vs 69.1% ± 19.9%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Most PDs (7/11, 63.6%) expressed satisfaction with current curricula vs 32.1% of residents. PDs identified time and educator shortages as main barriers to increased training. Neuroradiology training varies among programs. Residents expressed strong interest in commonly taught modalities, for which they also expressed high self-perceived competencies. However, PDs expressed greater satisfaction than residents with the current training. Leveraging interactions with neuroradiologists and online case-based learning while emphasizing trainees' interests can enhance postgraduate neuroradiology training for this useful skill.",

    "abstract": "As a high-degree-of-freedom approach to manipulate the electromagnetic wave, metasurfaces are widely used in high-capacity information technology. Extensive investigations have explored multiplexing techniques using polarization, incident angle, wavelength, and infinite-dimensional multiplexing through Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM). However, due to the limited spatial resolution and array size of the metasurface, the number of multiplexing channels that can be actually realized is limited. Therefore, research on the combination of OAM multiplexing and polarization degrees of freedom is of great significance. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a metasurface holography multiplexing scheme based on multiple polarization channels combined with OAM. Taking advantage of the orthogonal independence of spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum, multiple OAM multiplexing holograms are constructed in multiple different spin-polarization channels. Utilizing the well-established compatibility between OAM multiplexing and polarization multiplexing, we successfully integrated two multiplane holograms and 15 OAM multiplexing holograms on a single metasurface. Subsequently, we introduced an optical nested encryption framework designed for parallel communication. This work facilitates high-capacity and high-security holography by employing multiplexing metasurfaces, thereby providing innovative design concepts for optical communication, information encryption, and related domains.",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) has been frequently used to solve the inter-patient variability problem in EEG-based seizure prediction. However, existing DA methods require access to the existing patients' data when adapting the model, which leads to privacy concerns. Besides, most of them treat the whole existing patients' data as one single source and attempt to minimize the discrepancy with the target patient. This manner ignores the inter-patient variability among source patients, making the adaptation more difficult. Considering theses issues simultaneously, we present a novel multi-source-free semi-supervised domain adaptive seizure prediction model (MSF-SSDA-SPM). MSF-SSDA-SPM considers each source patient as one single source and generates a pretrained model from each source. Without requiring access to the source data, MSF-SSDA-SPM performs adaptation just using these pretrained source models and limited labeled target data. Specifically, we freeze the classifiers of all the source models and optimize the source feature extractors in a joint manner. Then we design a knowledge distillation strategy to integrate the knowledge of these well-adapted source models into one single target model. On the CHB-MIT dataset, MSF-SSDA-SPM attains a sensitivity of 88.6%, a FPR of 0.182/h and an AUC of 0.856; on the Kaggle dataset, it achieves 78.6%, 0.178/h and 0.784, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that MSF-SSDA-SPM achieves both high privacy-protection and promising prediction performance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the signs of biofilm in the maxillary sinus of patients with antrochoanal polyps (ACP), and status of the mucosa on which the biofilm occurred. Mucosal samples from maxillary sinus in 40 ACP patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery were analyzed histopathologically and by scanning electron microscopy. Results were compared with maxillary mucosa samples of 40 patients without endoscopic and radiological signs of sinus disease. The existence of biofilm and its relation to the degree of histopathological changes according to Terrier classification of chronic mucosal inflammation of maxillary sinus were statistically analyzed. Biofilm was detected in 23 of 40 (57.5%) ACP patients; the incidence was significantly lower in the control group (2/40, 5%). Biofilm was not found in type 1 mucosa according to Terrier classification. In conclusion, biofilm showed a significant incidence in the maxillary sinus mucosa of ACP patients (57.5%). Occasionally, biofilm can be found in patients with no signs of sinus disease, but not on histologically normal mucosa. Results of this study support the theory that biofilm formation does not represent the initial stage of the inflammatory process.",

    "abstract": "Women with a family history of breast cancer at an early age (≤50 years) have an increased risk of breast cancer themselves. To evaluate the effectiveness of a Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program (BrCaRRP) on increasing risk reduction behaviors, developing health beliefs, and screening participation in high-risk women with a family history of breast cancer. This is a single-center, single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. First-degree biological relatives of breast cancer patients (aged ≤50 years) were divided into intervention (n = 38) and control (n = 39) groups. The intervention (BrCaRRP) group received multiple interventions including education, counseling, case management, and surveillance via face-to-face and telephone interviews throughout a 12-week period, within the framework of the Health Belief Model and Health Promotion Model. The control group was given an information note, and the routine practice of the clinic was performed. Results were measured at baseline and at week 12 when the interventions were finished. The probability of participation in breast cancer screenings in the BrCaRRP group was 5.11 times higher. Health motivation was found to have increased in the intervention group. There was no difference in susceptibility and nutritional behavior between the groups. Health responsibility and physical activity increased in the intervention group. The frequency of consulting genetic counseling increased in the BrCaRRP group. Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program increased participation in screening in women and positively affected their health beliefs and behaviors. Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program could alter screening and health-promoting behaviors. However, other interventions are still needed to reduce the high level of fear.",

    "abstract": "Appreciative inquiry is an action research methodology focused on revealing an organization's positive core. As a cross-racial team of antiracist researchers, we were drawn to appreciative inquiry due to its congruences with community-based research perspectives on power-sharing and co-constructing knowledge. Our collaborative reflexivity brought us to question whether Appreciative inquiry's hyper-focus on positivity would fit our antiracist research paradigm. We articulate reflections of how antiracism theory informed our approach to Appreciative inquiry in a study on the experiences of predominantly racialized settlement workers in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explain how we negotiated tensions between Appreciative inquiry's focus on positivity and our antiracist framing, in a Canadian settler colonial context where institutional expectations to ignore racism and collapse diversity, loom large. Without a theoretical framework that attends to racism and power, Appreciative inquiry may not fulsomely address participants' transnational knowledges, nor experiences outside of a positive/negative binary. In our elucidation of how critical reflexivity on racism allowed us to integrate antiracism into Appreciative inquiry, we demonstrate the value of first-person action research for expanding the social justice aims of research.",

Secondary outcome measures were reduction in gain on vHIT following treatment as well as need for antiemetics postoperatively. <b>Results</b>  Ten patients have been treated at our center and the majority have shown preoperative reduction in gain and evidence of compensation on vHIT. Median time to mobilization was 1 day and modal length of stay was 6 days. We found the current evidence to be variable, with small sample sizes and significant variation in outcome measures used. <b>Conclusion</b>  Overall we have found that the use of vestibular prehabilitation enables early mobilization, shortened length of stay and appears to be a promising preoperative adjunct in this population.

    "abstract": "To compare the speech and voice patterns of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients over four years, and correlate the results with clinical aspects of the disease. Data was collected for 4 years. The clinical assessment tools included the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification, and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15-item Scale (MG-QoL). To assess speech, the recorded speaking tasks were analyzed acoustically and given auditory-perceptual ratings. Sex (equal distribution) and age (p=0.949) were used as matching criteria in the final sample, which consisted of 10 individuals in the MG group (MGG) and 10 individuals in the control group (CG). After 4 years, the MG participants presented stable health status, increased mild and moderate dysarthria (from 40% to 90% of the subjects), and a significant deterioration in the respiration, phonation, and articulation subsystems. The acoustic analysis showed a decline in articulatory patterns (speech rate p=0.047, articulation rate p=0.007, mean syllable duration p=0.007) and vocal quality (increased jitter p=0.022). In the follow-up comparison, there was a significant difference between the phonation variables (shimmer and harmonic-to-noise ratio) of the MGG and CG. The MG patients presented a decline in speech over four years and an increase in mild and moderate dysarthria. Despite presenting stable health status, their respiratory, phonatory, and articulatory subsystems worsened. There was no correlation between speech patterns and clinical characteristics of the disease (severity and motor scale).",

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Plastic surgery is routinely sought after for the treatment of breast cancer, cleft lip and palate, and gender-affirming care. Inequities exist in plastic surgery in regard to the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes experienced by patients. The purpose of our scoping review was to (1) outline current literature addressing health inequities in plastic surgery and (2) draw attention to the gaps in this literature. <b>Methods:</b> This scoping review was developed following guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. An initial search of MEDLINE (via PubMed), Ovid Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus databases was performed to locate published articles on health inequities in plastic surgery. Articles had to address at least one of the National Institutes of Health's inequity groups we examined. <b>Results:</b> After reviewing full text, 153 studies were included in our final sample. We found race/ethnicity (94/153) and age (90/153) to be the 2 most commonly evaluated inequities in the scoping review. We discovered that patient populations that were older had public or no insurance and/or were in historically marginalized racial/ethnic groups were often less likely to be offered plastic surgery treatments. <b>Conclusion:</b> This scoping review describes the current literature on health inequities in plastic surgery and highlights gaps in the literature that warrant further research. We found significant findings regarding how vulnerable patient populations are affected by health inequities. Research should be conducted to investigate these inequities more thoroughly and discover the best solutions to bridge the gaps in providing equitable care.",

    "abstract": "Under current and prominent definitions, the rates of parental involvement among Hispanic/Latino families have been historically low. However, empirical evidence suggests that parental involvement can be perceived/practiced in varied ways. This work explored these perceptions held by Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latino families through focus groups (<i>n</i> = 10) and individual interviews (<i>n</i> = 23) with parents of school-age children. Findings suggest that Spanish-speaking parents define parental involvement to include the emphasis of <i>educación</i> (a recognition that children's moral compasses and respectful behavior are a part of their formal education) and a parent-centered approach (involving the children in the parents everyday life), while navigating language barriers. Both Spanish- and English-speaking parents endorsed low parent-teacher communication and strong educational aspirations for their children. That is, parents expressed wanting their children to have a better life than the lives the parents have experienced themselves. This study offers empirical evidence that Spanish-speaking families are highly involved in their children's academic development and perceive themselves to play a critical role in their children's educational success. A shared understanding of values including culturally responsive measures to assess diverse parental involvement practices and adopting a cultural lens among teachers/educators is needed to accommodate diverse cultural parental involvement practices. Study findings can inform policies and practice to help pre-service teachers and educators to understand factors that determine Spanish-speaking families' engagement in school-based parental involvement.",

    "abstract": "The existing philosophical views on what is the meaning of causality adequate to medicine are vastly divided. We approach this question and offer two arguments in favor of pluralism regarding concepts of causality. First, we analyze the three main types of research designs (randomized-controlled trials, observational epidemiology and laboratory research). We argue, using examples, that they allow for making causal conclusions that are best understood differently in each case (in agreement with a version of manipulationist, probabilistic and mechanistic definitions, respectively). Second, we analyze clinical practice and argue that these manipulationist, probabilistic and mechanistic causal claims can be used as evidence for different therapeutic decisions. We differentiate among 'predicting' that does not change the relata of causal claims, (mechanistic) 'interferences', and 'interventions' in the strict sense that act on causes to change effects. The central conclusion is that causal claims agreeing with diverse concepts of causality can deliver evidence for different types of therapeutic decisions.",

    "abstract": "Indirect indices for faking detection in questionnaires make use of a respondent's deviant or unlikely response pattern over the course of the questionnaire to identify them as a faker. Compared with established direct faking indices (i.e., lying and social desirability scales), indirect indices have at least two advantages: First, they cannot be detected by the test taker. Second, their usage does not require changes to the questionnaire. In the last decades, several such indirect indices have been proposed. However, at present, the researcher's choice between different indirect faking detection indices is guided by relatively little information, especially if conceptually different indices are to be used together. Thus, we examined and compared how well indices of a representative selection of 12 conceptionally different indirect indices perform and how well they perform individually and jointly compared with an established direct faking measure or validity scale. We found that, first, the score on the agreement factor of the Likert-type item response process tree model, the proportion of desirable scale endpoint responses, and the covariance index were the best-performing indirect indices. Second, using indirect indices in combination resulted in comparable and in some cases even better detection rates than when using direct faking measures. Third, some effective indirect indices were only minimally correlated with substantive scales and could therefore be used to partial faking variance from response sets without losing substance. We, therefore, encourage researchers to use indirect indices instead of direct faking measures when they aim to detect faking in their data.",

Also, the relevance of this report is based on the lack of official data regarding the number of suicides across the country. The aim of this study was to explore the rate of adherence to the WHO guidelines of two popular newspapers in reporting on suicides in Pakistan. We daily analysed the online version of two popular newspapers in Pakistan, the daily <i>Jeejal</i> (in Sindhi) and daily <i>Jang</i> (in Urdu), from 1 August 2021 to 31 July 2022; we performed a content analysis of news reporting on national suicides and evaluated their rate of adherence to the WHO media guidelines. One hundred and seventy-three reports of suicides were identified and analysed; 84% of them reported the names of victims, 70% reported their age, and 46% included information regarding their occupation. Characteristics of suicide methods were reported in 87% of reports, reasons for suicide in 66%, as well as locations in 87%. In general, 84% of newspapers reported incomplete information regarding suicide prevention and help-seeking, so we may conclude they were not fully adherent to the WHO recommendations. This study indicates that national vernacular newspapers may improve their reporting on suicides and should revise their policy in order to be adherent to the WHO guidelines. Also, better and responsible reporting may provide an accurate epidemiological source regarding suicide where official data are missing at the national level.",

The case involved a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of dysphagia. He was diagnosed with an esophageal diverticulum (Zenker's diverticulum) measuring 10 cm in diameter. Five years later, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an iodine-unstained 0-IIb lesion of 20 mm in diameter with type B1 vessels in the diverticulum. An endoscopic biopsy and CT revealed it to be squamous cell carcinoma, cT1a-EP/LPM N0 M0, cStage 0. Because the lesion was in the diverticulum and endoscopic resection was difficult with the risk of perforation, surgical resection was set as the course of treatment. Diverticulectomy was performed via a cervical approach, using a stapler, and the patient was discharged on the 16th day without any complications. The pathological diagnosis was pTis-EP, ly0, v0, R0. We think this case is very rare and diverticulectomy of early esophageal cancer in the diverticulum is available and safe.",

Higher glucose level was related to higher mortality rate (p=0.001). On the other hand, sodium level was not significantly associated with survival. Higher mortality, as well as higher glucose concentration were more common in patients older than 65 years (p<0.001). Study results showed significantly lower glucose concentrations in patients with acute kidney injury, whereas in patients older than 65, glucose concentration was significantly higher.

    "abstract": "Red blood cell (RBC) indices serve as clinically important parameters for diagnosing various blood-related diseases. Conventional hematology analyzers provide the highly accurate detection of RBC indices but require large blood volumes (>1 mL), and the results are bulk mean values averaged over a large number of RBCs. Moreover, they do not provide quantitative information related to the morphological and chemical alteration of RBCs at the single-cell level. Recently, quantitative phase imaging (QPI) methods have been introduced as viable detection platforms for RBC indices. However, coherent QPI methods are built on complex optical setups and suffer from coherent speckle noise, which limits their detection accuracy and precision. Here, we present spectroscopic differential phase-contrast (sDPC) microscopy as a platform for measuring RBC indices. sDPC is a computational microscope that produces color-dependent phase images with higher spatial resolution and reduced speckle noise compared to coherent QPIs. Using these spectroscopic phase images and computational algorithms, RBC indices can be extracted with high accuracy. We experimentally demonstrate that sDPC enables the high-accuracy measurement of the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red cell distribution width, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and RBC count with errors smaller than 7% as compared to a clinical hematology analyzer based on flow cytometry (XN-2000; Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). We further validate the clinical utility of the sDPC method by measuring and comparing the RBC indices of the control and anemic groups against those obtained using the clinical hematology analyzer.",

    "abstract": "Optical clearing of invertebrates, the number of species of which is 20 times greater than that of vertebrates, is of fundamental and applied interest for neuroscience in general. Herein, the optical clearing of invertebrates to identify their morphology and neurostructure remains unrealized as of yet. Here, we report on fast (from a few seconds to minutes) and uniform whole-body optical clearing of invertebrates (bivalves, nemertines, annelids, and anomura) of any age and thickness (up to 2 cm) possessing complicated structures and integuments. We developed the protocol unifying dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-based immunostaining of the animals followed by their optical clearing with benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate (BABB). Confocal microspectroscopy revealed that the protocol provides an increase of the fluorescence signal by 2 orders of magnitude and decrease of the light scattering by 2 orders of magnitude, thereby accelerating the confocal bioimaging of the whole body. Moreover, by tracking the optical clearing over time with 0.3 s resolution, we revealed that the clearing process is described by the Gompertz growth function, allowing us to determine the physical mechanism of the clearing and its optical parameters. Thereby, we were able to identify in detail and to describe previously unknown neurostructures of different invertebrate animals, paving the way to discovery in neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "The significance of ultrafast laser-induced energy and mass transfer at interfaces has been growing in the field of nanoscience and technology. Nevertheless, the complexity arising from non-linear and non-equilibrium optical-thermal-mechanical interactions results in intricate transitional behaviors. This complexity presents challenges when attempting to analyze these phenomena exclusively through modeling or experimentation. In this study, we conduct time-resolved reflective pump-probe imaging and molecular-dynamics coupled two-temperature model (MD-TTM) simulations to investigate the ultrafast dynamics and ablation mechanism of Au/Ti bilayer systems. The calculated energy absorption curves indicate that Au film reduces the energy deposition in the underlying Ti layer, resulting in reduced melting and evaporation rate of Ti. The phase transition process induces different mechanical responses. The potential energy patterns indicate that the expansion of vapor Ti extrudes the surface Au layer outward. In simulated stress distribution images, the Au layer can hamper the expansion of the vapor-phase Ti and brings dynamic compressive stress to the residual Ti layer. When the compressive stress transforms into tensile stress, the material is removed through mechanical damage. Therefore, both Au and Ti in the 20 nm Au-covered Ti are completely removed. Our approach elucidates the ablation mechanism within the Au/Ti bilayer system and offers fresh insights into managing thermo-mechanical responses within analogous systems.",

Emergency open chest surgery was performed, and the pericardial sac was filled with copious amounts of pus. The fish bone-like foreign body was found to penetrate the pericardial membrane from the diaphragmatic side. The foreign body was removed, a drainage tube was placed, and the chest was closed. After 2 weeks of postoperative antibiotics, the patient was discharged from the hospital in stable general condition. Three months after the surgery, the patient had no recurrence of pericarditis. We reported a rare case of gastrointestinal perforation by a fish bone, resulting in pericardium, which was treated by surgical drainage.",

    "abstract": "Zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) is an essential element that can promote proper organ function, cell growth, and immune response; it can also, however, be present in too great a quantity. Zinc toxicity caused by overexposure may result in both minor and major physiological effects, with chronic exposure at low levels and acute exposure at high levels being harmful or even toxic. This investigation examines the effects of acute exposure to relatively high concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on sensory nerve function and nerve conduction. A proprioceptive nerve in marine crab (<i>Callinectes sapidus</i>) limbs was used as a model to assess the effects of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on stretch-activated channels (SACs) and evoked nerve conduction. Exposure to Zn<sup>2+</sup> slowed nerve condition rapidly; however, several minutes were required before the SACs in sensory endings were affected. A depression in conduction speed and an increase followed by a decrease in amplitude were observed for the evoked compound action potential, while the frequency of nerve activity upon joint movement and stretching of the chordotonal organ significantly decreased. These altered responses could be partially reversed via extensive flushing with fresh saline to remove the zinc. This indicates that subtle, long-term exposure to Zn<sup>2+</sup> may alter an organism's SAC function for channels related to proprioception and nerve conduction.",

Herein, we present a case of a large chest wall cyst with rapid growth 5 years after thoracic surgery. A male patient in his 60s was admitted to our hospital complaining of a rapidly enlarging chest wall swelling. He underwent a pleural biopsy for pleural thickening and was diagnosed with pleurisy 5 years ago. Computed tomography revealed a cystic lesion with a capsule measuring 14 cm × 10 cm, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed a heterogeneous enhancement effect inside the lesion. Surgical resection was performed for definitive diagnosis and therapeutic purposes. Intraoperatively, a cystic lesion with a thick capsule located outside the thorax was seen. The lesion was resected completely with no remaining adherence to the surrounding tissues and muscles. Histopathological examination revealed that the cyst wall was a non-epithelial fibrous connective tissue with inflammatory cell infiltration, and the contents were viscous liquid and fibrin, suggestive of a chest wall cyst. The cyst wall had abundant CD34-positive vascular endothelium, suggestive of rapid enlargement due to the influx of exudate associated with angiogenesis. No recurrence was observed 1 year postoperatively. In addition to bacteriology, pathological examination, including immunohistological examination, is useful for the differential diagnosis of chest wall cystic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Between the late 1940s and the early 1970s, the majority of teenage girls in Britain attended secondary modern schools. Yet, histories of the meaning and experience of postwar education continue to neglect this constituent of postwar women, favouring grammar-school leavers. This article draws upon a set of fifty-eight newly mined life histories from two postwar birth cohort studies to recapture the perspectives of ordinary women who attended secondary modern schools in England, Wales, and Scotland between c.1957 and c.1963. The longitudinal sources show that these women developed their attitudes to education gradually, across their lifecourses. Hairdressing, which stood for a desire for clean, creative, and autonomous paid work that could be balanced with domesticity, is identified as a reoccurring theme in the testimonies of secondary modern women. The article diagnoses secondary modern women with the hairdresser blues, a formulation that encapsulates their collective expectations, disappointments, and regrets born out of their closely interlinked experiences of schooling and paid work across the 1960s and early 1970s. These women's educational attitudes were defined by the cumulative realization that a secondary modern education might not even be able to make you into a hairdresser. The article ultimately suggests that it was more often the hairdresser blues rather than 'missing out' on the prestigious grammar school that politicized secondary modern schools for the ordinary women who attended them.",

    "abstract": "Although traditionally considered protective, certain forms of positive future thinking (PFT) may be associated with greater suicide risk. In this first a priori investigation of potential maladaptive forms of PFT, we tested whether novelty (i.e., dissimilarity to past experiences) and lack of attainment of the imagined positive future may explain counterintuitive associations between PFT and suicidal ideation (SI). At baseline, adolescents (<i>N</i> = 76, ages 12-19) completed a behavioral measure of PFT (i.e., Future Thinking Task) and rated the novelty of each positive future thought. At the 3-month follow-up, we measured attainment of the positive future events generated at baseline by asking adolescents whether the event happened and, if it did, if it was as positive as had been imagined at baseline. Past-month SI severity was assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. PFT, only when highly novel, was associated with stronger recent SI severity at baseline, above and beyond depressive symptoms. It also significantly predicted recent SI severity 3 and 6 months later, although not after we controlled for baseline SI severity. Novelty of the imagined positive future was not related to whether the event happened. However, when those events did happen, adolescents who imagined more novel events tended to experience them less positively than imagined, which separately predicted stronger recent SI severity at the 6-month follow-up. Results support that PFT is a heterogeneous construct that is not uniformly beneficial. Better understanding potential pitfalls of PFT may help us discern how to best incorporate PFT into clinical interventions.",

    "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a cytosolic protein complex that regulates innate immune signaling in response to diverse pathogenic insults through the proteolytic processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β. Hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling is implicated in the onset and pathogenesis of numerous diseases, motivating the discovery of new strategies to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activity. We sought to define the potential for the proteostasis regulator AA147 to inhibit the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. AA147 is a pro-drug that is metabolically converted to a reactive metabolite at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to covalently modify ER-localized proteins such as protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We show that AA147 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activity in monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages through a mechanism involving impaired assembly of the active inflammasome complex. This inhibition is mediated through AA147-dependent covalent modification of PDIA1. Genetic depletion or treatment with other highly selective PDIA1 inhibitors similarly blocks NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Our results identify PDIA1 as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling implicated in etiologically diverse diseases.",

It grounds its analysis in a 'decentred' understanding of regulation; a socio-legal approach which moves beyond formal regulation and regulators, and instead foregrounds diverse social actors and their attempts to alter behaviour across a given domain. Focussing on <i>The Times</i> newspaper as a case-study, it identifies five regulatory techniques through which the newspaper drew (and redrew) lines separating the safe from the risky, the efficacious from the sham, and the normal from the deviant. By analytically decentring CAM's formal regulation, this article provides a conceptual contribution. It highlights an everyday form of healthcare regulation directed at prospective users which may be just as significant in potentially guiding users towards or away from particular healthcare practices/practitioners as the more traditional, formal kinds of regulation identified in regulatory literatures.",

    "abstract": "Slowly reproducing and long-lived terrestrial mammals are often more at risk from challenges that influence fitness and survival. It is, therefore, important to understand how animals cope with such challenges and how coping mechanisms translate over generations and affect phenotypic plasticity. Rapidly escalating anthropogenic challenges may further diminish an animal's ability to reinstate homeostasis. Research to advance insights on elephant stress physiology has predominantly focused on relative or comparative analyses of a major stress response marker, glucocorticoids (GCs), across different ecological, anthropogenic, and reproductive contexts. This paper presents an extensive review of published findings on Asian and African elephants from 1980 to 2023 (May) and reveals that stress responses, as measured by alterations in GCs in different sample matrices, often are highly dynamic and vary within and across individuals exposed to similar stimuli, and not always in a predictable fashion. Such dynamicity in physiological reactivity may be mediated by individual differences in personality traits or coping styles, ecological conditions, and technical factors that often are not considered in study designs. We describe probable causations under the 'Physiological Dynamicity Model', which considers context-experience-individuality effects. Highly variable adrenal responses may affect physiological plasticity with potential fitness and survival consequences. This review also addresses the significance of cautious interpretations of GCs data in the context of normal adaptive stress versus distress. We emphasize the need for long-term assessments of GCs that incorporate multiple markers of 'stress' and 'well-being' to decipher the probable fitness consequences of highly dynamic physiological adrenal responses in elephants. Ultimately, we propose that assessing GC responses to current and future challenges is one of the most valuable and informative conservation tools we have for guiding conservation strategies.",

    "abstract": "As part of the ongoing evolution towards personalized anticancer therapy, mutation screening is becoming increasingly important and, therefore, also alternative detection strategies that allow for fast genetic diagnostics at the point of care. In the case of breast cancer, detecting cancer-associated point mutations in the PIK3CA gene is of particular importance for treatment decisions. We developed a recombinase polymerase amplification assay combined with an enzyme-linked electrochemical assay on multi-channel screen-printed gold sensors for specific and highly sensitive detection of three PIK3CA point mutations (H1047R, E545K, and E542K). Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) of the target sequences was optimized and characterized with a real-time RPA assay. Comparison with real-time PCR reveals that RPA is slightly inferior in terms of efficiency and sensitivity. However, the desired target DNA is successfully amplified at initial concentrations down to 100 copies μL<sup>-1</sup>. For electrochemical readout, biotinylated dCTP is used to label the target DNA during RPA. Single-stranded target DNA is produced with either asymmetric RPA or symmetric RPA followed by lambda exonuclease digestion. Characterization of the two different approaches in terms of sensitivity results in comparable detection limits (229 copies μL<sup>-1</sup> and 224 copies μL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively), though RPA followed by lambda exonuclease digestion yields significantly higher currents. Finally, this method, together with a designed wild-type blocking oligo that inhibits binding of the wild-type target DNA during probe-target hybridization, allows for detecting the PIK3CA point mutations H1047R, E545K, and E542K in the presence of wild-type target DNA when the proportion of mutant target DNA is >20%.",

    "abstract": "In bronchoplasty of wedge resections, it is necessary to transect the bronchus at a sharp angle and depth. As a result, anastomoses after wedge resections have the disadvantages of poor visibility and operability. Here, we report a case of right wedge-shaped sleeve bilobectomy that was successfully performed with continuous knotless suturing using robotic assistance. An 81-year-old male patient was referred for the treatment of a tumor in the right lower lobe, which protruded into the bronchus intermedius. The tumor was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma by transbronchial biopsy, cT1cN1M0 stage IIB carcinoma for which surgery was indicated. Because the pulmonary middle lobe artery was involved and a resection margin from the tumor protruding into the bronchial mucosal epithelium was necessary, a right wedge-shaped sleeve bilobectomy was performed. The bronchial anastomosis was performed with robotic assistance. After dissection of pulmonary vessels and interlobes, the upper lobe bronchial bifurcation was transected in a wedged shape, and a lower bilobectomy was performed. The bronchi were sutured continuously with knotless sutures. A continuous suture was performed from the ventral to the caudal side. After suturing to the dorsal side, another continuous suturing was performed from the cranial side. Continuous sutures were made until each thread passed through the other. Pericardial fat was wrapped around the anastomosis. A better visual field could be obtained owing to robot-assisted surgery, and robotic arms enabled an accurate and safe operation. Furthermore, continuous suturing using a knotless suture made it easier for the sutures to be handled and enabled bronchial anastomosis without assistance.",

    "abstract": "Although water stagnation is widely accepted as an essential factor supporting <i>Legionella</i> growth in plumbing systems and \"water flashing\" has become a common action for water quality control, additional monitoring data in practical spaces are still needed to back up this recommendation. The lockdown of public buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic provided an ideal time window to collect such data on a large scale. This study investigated how the long-term lockdown of a public building and the subsequent water stagnation impact water quality and the population of <i>Legionella</i> in water. From June 2020 to May 2021, 192 water samples were collected from a public building during the lockdown and reopening due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each water sample was assessed for common physicochemical characteristics. Concentrations of <i>Legionella</i> and three species of free-living amoeba (FLA) (<i>Acanthamoeba</i> spp., <i>Naegleria fowleri</i>, and <i>Hartmannella vermiformis</i>) were monitored by qPCR. The data suggest that long-term stagnation promotes the population of <i>Legionella</i> spp., <i>Acanthamoeba</i> spp., and <i>N. fowleri</i>. Notable associations were observed between <i>Legionella</i> and FLA. These relationships were impacted by stagnation. These results provide important evidence that can inform future water quality management actions to minimize the risk of <i>Legionella</i> outbreaks by avoiding the occurrence of water stagnation.",

    "title": "FastSurfer-HypVINN: Automated sub-segmentation of the hypothalamus and adjacent structures on high-resolutional brain MRI.",
    "abstract": "The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in the regulation of a broad range of physiological, behavioral, and cognitive functions. However, despite its importance, only a few small-scale neuroimaging studies have investigated its substructures, likely due to the lack of fully automated segmentation tools to address scalability and reproducibility issues of manual segmentation. While the only previous attempt to automatically sub-segment the hypothalamus with a neural network showed promise for 1.0 mm isotropic T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there is a need for an automated tool to sub-segment also high-resolutional (HiRes) MR scans, as they are becoming widely available, and include structural detail also from multi-modal MRI. We, therefore, introduce a novel, fast, and fully automated deep-learning method named <i>HypVINN</i> for sub-segmentation of the hypothalamus and adjacent structures on 0.8 mm isotropic T1w and T2w brain MR images that is robust to missing modalities. We extensively validate our model with respect to segmentation accuracy, generalizability, in-session test-retest reliability, and sensitivity to replicate hypothalamic volume effects (e.g., sex differences). The proposed method exhibits high segmentation performance both for standalone T1w images as well as for T1w/T2w image pairs. Even with the additional capability to accept flexible inputs, our model matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods with fixed inputs. We, further, demonstrate the generalizability of our method in experiments with 1.0 mm MR scans from both the Rhineland Study and the UK Biobank-an independent dataset never encountered during training with different acquisition parameters and demographics. Finally, <i>HypVINN</i> can perform the segmentation in less than a minute (graphical processing unit [GPU]) and will be available in the open source <i>FastSurfer</i> neuroimaging software suite, offering a validated, efficient, and scalable solution for evaluating imaging-derived phenotypes of the hypothalamus.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of mycothalli, symbioses between liverworts and fungi, is poorly documented in sub-Antarctica, and biogeographical patterns in Serendipita, the main fungal genus forming the symbiosis, remain understudied. Here, 83 specimens of 16 leafy liverwort species were sampled from sub-Antarctic South Georgia and were examined for mycothalli. Microscopy was used to enumerate fungal structures in liverwort tissues, and sequencing of fungal ribosomal DNA was used to determine the taxonomic and biogeographical affinities of the fungi. Stained hyphal coils, a defining feature of the symbiosis, were found to be frequent (>40% of stem length colonised) in Barbilophozia hatcheri, Cephaloziella varians and Lophoziopsis excisa. A single species of Serendipita, based on a 3% cut-off for ITS2 region sequence divergence, was a frequent colonist of these liverworts. A further 18 basidiomycete and ascomycete taxa colonised other liverwort species. The presence of the Serendipita species was positively associated with the occurrence of stained hyphal coils in stem epidermal cells. Phylogenetic analyses, incorporating worldwide accessions from leafy liverwort-associated Serendipita, showed that the same species, which also occurs in Chile, mainland Europe and on Svalbard, is apparently the sole symbiont of sub- and maritime Antarctic leafy liverworts, and indicated much higher species richness of the genus outside Antarctica.",

    "abstract": "Lipid rafts (LRs) are relatively well-ordered functional microdomains in cell membranes and play an irreplaceable role in physiological processes as a transduction platform for multiple signaling pathways. Due to their small size and high spatiotemporal dynamics, it is difficult to perform lipid raft-localized biomolecule imaging on the surface of living cells. Here, we report a DNA nanotechnology-based platform for reversible manipulation and localized analysis of lipid rafts, which consists of two modules: \"patching and coding probe pair\" and \"fishing probe\". The probe pair is generated by modifying two different sets of connectable DNA structures on a lipid raft-specific protein. After recognizing lipid rafts, the two probes in close proximity are linked by a DNA ligase reaction to form a lipid raft identity (LR-ID) code. The LR-ID strand patches and stabilizes the lipid raft structure. Interestingly, the raft patches formed can be depatched by restriction endonucleases, providing the first reversible manipulation of the lipid raft structure in living cells. We also designed a \"fishing probe\" with a DNA hairpin structure using an aptamer that can specifically bind to the target. The probe can cascade the reaction to two input signals \"LR-ID\" and \"target protein\" to generate an \"off-on\" fluorescence switch, allowing imaging and dynamic monitoring of target proteins localized in lipid rafts. By encoding arbitrary targets (in the case of glycans) in lipid rafts, we have created a universal lipid raft-localized imaging platform. This work provides an integrated analytical and manipulative platform to reveal lipid rafts and associated signaling pathways at the molecular level.",

Care as a clinic committed to the integrality of the health-disease process and to the autonomy of the subjects, which takes place in the intercessory encounters. It deals with two dimensions of care time: the chronos or duration between two events, which guides health interventions with deadlines and goals to control the results; and the aiôn temporality of events. Such dimensions are examined in the society of performance or weariness, and the possibility of privileging interruptions, the contemplative \"not doing\" and the temporal in-between. Based on the propositions of a social movement and a verbal neologism, \"slow care\" is proposed as the construction of strategies for managing either the various chronological times that cross the health care, and the opening of oneself to events and the interferences they produce, as resonances, subtleties, small changes (aiôn). Finally, harm reduction is pointed out as a strategy of slow care.",

The patient had been abusing alcohol and nicotine for several decades, which should be considered an immunosuppressive factor. Staphylococcus warneri is part of the skin microbiome, but can also be a pathogenic agent in certain circumstances. Pleural fluid is an unusual site of isolation for the staphylococcus described. The literature contains case reports of arthritis, endocarditis, urinary tract infection or infection associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis caused by Staphylococcus warneri. With the development of medicine, the phenomenon of immunosuppression is becoming more common, posing the threat of an increase in invasive infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. In addition, an overly liberal use of antibiotics may contribute to the generation of multidrug resistance in these micro-organisms.",

In this study, we evaluated the capacity of surgical applications and treatments made to the surgery department in the first 3 months of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective cohort study was performed from March 12, 2020 to June 1, 2020. COVID-19 negative general surgery patients were included. Demographics, diagnosis and management were recorded, as well as bed turnover and length of stay in the hospital. Similar data were collected on patients admitted during the same period in 2019 and 2018 to allow for comparison. A total of 1764 operations were included. There was a reduction in surgeries when comparing 2020 with 2019 and 2018 (164 <i>vs.</i> 713 and 890); however, there was no difference in the length of stay in the hospital (4.12 <i>vs.</i> 4.37 and 4.07 days, p=0.626). During 2020, appendectomies decreased (53 <i>vs.</i> 102 and 100, p=0.013). There was no difference in the number of emergency oncologic surgeries during 2020 as compared with 2019 and 2018 (16 <i>vs.</i> 8 and 13, p=0.149). In conclusion, COVID-19 significantly impacted the number of admissions to general surgery. However, cancer and emergency operations continued to be required, thus provisions need to be made to enable planning these interventions.",

    "abstract": "Congenital bronchial atresia (CBA) is a rare bronchial abnormality. Adult patients with CBA generally do not show any symptoms. Although surgical resection is the first-line treatment, the indication for the surgical intervention is controversial, especially in mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Recently, thoracoscopic surgery is the commonly preferred approach to treat this condition. Case 1: A woman in her 20s suffered from repeating episodes of fever and cough due to left CBA with the interruption of B9 and B10. Uniportal thoracoscopic left lower lobe wedge resection was performed, following which the symptoms disappeared. Case 2: A woman in her 40s presented to the clinic with dyspnea on exertion, and the computed tomography image revealed the absence of B2. Multiportal thoracoscopic right S2 segmentectomy was performed on her, after which the symptoms of dyspnea improved. Case 3: A woman in her 40s visited the hospital with symptoms of intermittent cough, sputum, and slight fever for 7 months. The examinations identified the absence of B6a. Right S6 segmentectomy and S2 wedge resection were carried out by multiportal thoracoscopic approach. The patient is now asymptomatic. Based on our experiences in the three adult CBA surgery cases, the three-dimensional image reconstruction system is very useful for diagnosis and surgical decisions with regard to this disease. Even for CBA patients with subtle symptoms, early surgical treatments may be beneficial from the point of view of minimally invasive interventions, and sublobar resection will be sufficient for treatments and preservation of respiratory function.",

    "abstract": "In structured light tweezers, it is a challenging technical issue to realize the complete circular motion of the trapped particles parallel to the optical axis. Herein, we propose and generate a novel optical skipping rope via combining beam shaping technology, Fourier shift theorem, and beam grafting technology. This optical skipping rope can induce the transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) (i.e., nominal OAM, whose direction is perpendicular to the optical axis) and transfer it to the particles, so that the particles have a transverse torque, thereby causing the particles to rotate parallel to the optical axis. Experimentally, our optical tweezers validate that the designed optical skipping rope realizes the orbital motion of polystyrene particles parallel to the optical axis. Additionally, the experiments also demonstrate that the optical skipping ropes manipulate particles to move along the oblique coil trajectory and three-dimensional (3D) cycloidal trajectory. Using the laser beam induced OAM, this innovative technology increases the degree of freedom for manipulating particles, which is of great significance for the application of optical tweezers in optical manipulation, micromechanics, and mimicry of celestial orbits.",

A 34-year-old female patient with isolated right UAPA was referred to our hospital with a complaint of fever. Chest radiography and computed tomography showed an infectious cavity in the right upper lung. Surgery was scheduled for the patient; however, her preoperative condition needed to be optimized. She was evaluated for pulmonary hypertension and the collateral arteries were mapped out, and a waiting period after treatment of infection was set to avoid perioperative intrathoracic infections. Resection of the infected bulla was performed without any complications. No recurrence of infection was observed two years post-operatively. The residual lung expanded enough to fill the dead intrathoracic space. This report suggests the importance of adequate preoperative evaluation and perioperative management for patients with isolated UAPA who require surgical resection.",

    "abstract": "This article describes F-IVM, a unified approach for maintaining analytics over changing relational data. We exemplify its versatility in four disciplines: processing queries with group-by aggregates and joins; learning linear regression models using the covariance matrix of the input features; building Chow-Liu trees using pairwise mutual information of the input features; and matrix chain multiplication. F-IVM has three main ingredients: higher-order incremental view maintenance; factorized computation; and ring abstraction. F-IVM reduces the maintenance of a task to that of a hierarchy of simple views. Such views are functions mapping keys, which are tuples of input values, to payloads, which are elements from a ring. F-IVM supports efficient factorized computation over keys, payloads, and updates. It treats uniformly seemingly disparate tasks: While in the key space, all tasks require general joins and variable marginalization, in the payload space, tasks differ in the definition of the sum and product ring operations. We implemented F-IVM on top of DBToaster and show that it can outperform classical first-order and fully recursive higher-order incremental view maintenance by orders of magnitude while using less memory.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was analyzed the neuropsychological functions of students from a public school in Brazil, enrolled in the 1st and 2nd year of Elementary School at the time of the reopening of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic and to access the influence of family and contextual information on the performance of these skills. 117 students participated in the study, as well as their parents or guardians. The children were evaluated in person using the Brief Child Neuropsychological Assessment Instrument (NEUPSILIN-Inf). The parents/guardians answered remotely the Inventory of Resources of the Family Environment and questions about socioeconomic classification and maternal education. The data showed a high prevalence of children who had problems or deficits in the functions of orientation, memory, language, visuospatial skills, arithmetic skills and verbal fluency. Furthermore, predictable activities that signal some degree of stability in family life are predictors of children's performance in orientation skills and resources that promote proximal processes significantly reflect on language performance. The results suggest that children included in families with a household income below one Brazilian minimum monthly salary presented poorer inhibitory control performances. The impact of changes in neuropsychological skills in children's learning were presented and discussed, highlighting the need for immediate and targeted intervention of these functions. Contextual factors that influenced the performance of neuropsychological skills were also considered.",

    "title": "Suicide as slow death: towards a haunted sociology of suicide.",
    "abstract": "Sociological research on suicide has tended to favour functionalist approaches, and quantitative methods. This paper argues for an alternative engagement - drawing on interpretive paradigms, and inspired by 'live' methodologies, we make an argument for a haunted sociology of suicide. This approach, informed by Avery Gordon's haunted sociological imagination and Lauren Berlant's concept of slow death, works between the structural realities of inequalities in suicide rates and the more (in)tangible <i>affects</i> of suicide as they are lived. These theoretical engagements are illustrated through an empirical study which used collaborative, arts-based discussion groups about suicide. The groups were held with 14 people, all affected in different ways by suicide, and attending a community-based mental health centre in a semi-rural location in Scotland, UK. A narrative-informed analysis of data generated through these groups shows the creative potential of both arts-based methodologies, and interpretive sociologies, in deepening understanding of how inequalities in rates of suicide may be experienced and made sense of. We illustrate this via two related metaphors ('the point' and 'the edge') which recurred in the data. Our analysis underlines the vital relevance of sociology to suicide studies - and the urgent need for diverse sociological engagement and action on this topic.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method for the modal analysis of slow-varying vibration structures based on vector autoregressive models. The basic idea of this method consists of using a short-time sliding window (STSW) to identify modal parameters for non-stationary vibrations. This method uses the recursive least-squares estimation for multivariable systems with the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to find the solutions within a segment of the data from each time window. Model identification is conducted by updating the SVD of the data matrix using the order and time from the previous computational window to monitor the modal parameters of a slow-varying system. Finally, this work was validated first by numerically simulating a system's gradual changes submitted to an exciting force and further by an experiment on a hydraulic turbine blade.",

    "abstract": "Connections between prosociality and antisocial behaviors have been recognized; however, little research has studied their developmental links longitudinally. This is important to illuminate during early adolescence as a sensitive period for social development in which prosociality could protect against the development of later antisocial behaviors. This study investigates the within-person developmental links between prosociality and antisocial behaviors, as well as a potential mediating role of peer relationships, across ages 11, 13, and 15 (<i>N</i> = 1526; 51% male) using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models. Results indicated that neither self-reported nor teacher-reported prosociality was associated with reduced aggressive behaviors but suggested a direct protective ('promotive') effect of teacher-reported prosociality on bullying perpetration. These findings suggest that promoting prosociality in early adolescence may help reduce some antisocial behaviors over early to mid-adolescent development. Improving prosociality could be explored as a target in intervention approaches such as school-based anti-bullying interventions.",

    "title": "Compassion Fatigue among Nurses Assigned to COVID-19 Facilities: A Constructivist Grounded Theory.",
    "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic significantly disrupted regular health care services, mainly in the hospitals. Nurses soldiering on the battlefront of care of disaster response in the Philippines during the disease outbreak are at high risk of developing rapid-onset compassion fatigue. Notably, research is still needed to investigate the impact of compassion fatigue on various clinical areas and further develop a theory of compassion fatigue within the nursing context. The study explored the concept of compassion as experienced by nurses directly caring for COVID-19 patients. The study further explored the experiences of nurses on compassion fatigue. This study employed qualitative methodology, specifically the constructivist grounded theory. Thirty-four participants were included in the study. The narratives and voices of the nurses unfolded the following themes: (1) Acts of Compassion, (2) COVID-19 Pandemic: Nursing Challenges and Detours, (3) Nurses' Compassion Fatigue, (4) Narratives of Opportunities: Thriving at the outset of COVID-19. All four concepts are linked to the multidimensional concept of compassion fatigue. A substantive theory, \"Remon's CF Theory in Nursing,\" is proposed based on the grounded experiences of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients related to compassion fatigue. Compassion Fatigue (CF) is a psycho-social phenomenon and occupational hazard affecting nurses directly caring for or in contact with COVID-19 patients. CF is a process that develops over time brought by prolonged enactment of compassion, the experience of empathic distress, and concurrence of organizational, contextual, and psychosocial factors. Nurses' CF can potentially affect safety and lead to poor nursing care, compromised work relations, and burnout. Nurse leaders' organizational and leadership commitment and support through up-to-date policies and continuous research on the topic are necessary to regain compassion among nurses. Likewise, reframing nurse compassion fatigue as an organizational and collective problem provides the larger perspective to further improve clinical practice and nurses' welfare. Nurse leaders, hospital and COVID-19 facility administrators must ensure specific policies and priorities that address issues causing and fueling nurse compassion fatigue, including frequency of exposure to traumatic events, lack of resources, and inadequate support system. The study further suggests conducting quantitative research to test the proposed theory and explore the relationship between organizational, psychosocial, and environmental context, compassion fatigue, and compassion-driven factors.",

We present the case of a 50-year-old patient with a history of dermatomyositis and antisynthetase syndrome on immunosuppressive therapy, who consulted due to increased volume of the lacrimal gland in the upper left eyelid, associated with weight loss and night sweats. He was admitted for an elective biopsy. The day after the postoperative period, she evolved with an acute abdomen. Computed axial tomography revealed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands associated with a perforated tumor in the transverse colon and free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. In this scenario, an infectious, neoplastic, or rheumatological etiology was considered a differential diagnosis, especially in the context of our patient. Finally, the biopsies evidenced extensive necrosis with angiocentric and angiodestructive lymphoid infiltration associated with positive EBV. After extensively reviewing the symptoms, histology, and new classifications of mature B-lymphoid neoplasms, the diagnosis of polymorphic B-lymphoproliferative disorder, lymphomatoid granulomatosis-type was made, an uncommon entity rarely associated with iatrogenic immunosuppression.",

    "abstract": "This article sheds fresh light on popular attitudes towards politics in the 1940s. It does so by reading against the grain of archived material from Mass-Observation's (M-O) study of the 1945 General Election, as it played out in the constituency of Fulham East. Where the formal reports from this investigation have underpinned influential accounts of 'apathy' in 1945, this article returns to the original field notes from the investigation. By attending to the framing of the M-O encounter in Fulham, it suggests that we can reinterpret seemingly apathetic responses as a reaction to the alienating high expectations underpinning the M-O questionnaire, exacerbated by the classed and gendered dynamics of the interview. In other instances, however, it argues displays of apathy or ignorance could indicate the popular delimiting of an appropriate level of political interest, confining this to voting, in contrast to the importance of critical, detailed 'study' of politics implicit within the questionnaire. The article consequently contributes to the ongoing discussions surrounding the re-use of archived social-science material by suggesting that we can only rely on such material to gain access to 'vernacular' attitudes when we reckon with its fundamentally mediated nature, framed by the assumptions and intersubjective dynamics of the social-science encounter. In turn, it offers an example of how recent interest in the vernacular might be combined with an older, more traditional form of political history, centred on elections.",

Young people, specifically young couples, were agreeing to die together, in what would become known as a 'suicide pact'. This article examines the curiously brief life of the suicide pact as a legal, social, and cultural problem in Britain. It contends that the suicide pact became a site through which the scale and pace of modern life, and particularly intimate life, was debated and judged. The suicide pact, this article argues, provides another vantage point to unpack the fraught twentieth-century relationship between individual freedom in sexual life, and the norms, values and patterns of community and the family. In exploring this tension, this article also presents a new way of thinking about the history of both intimate and social life in twentieth-century Britain.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to few-layer black phosphorus (BP) with a relatively larger area, BP quantum dots (BP-QDs) are expected to have distinctive electromagnetic response and carrier behaviors, especially in low-frequency range such as in the THz regime. Herein, we experimentally investigate the THz properties of BP-QDs as well as the optical control of these properties. It is demonstrated that the effects of weak carrier confinement, which is associated with diffusive restoring current in each BP-QD, contribute significantly to the effective THz conductivity of BP-QDs. Instead, spectral features of discretely spaced energy levels as shown for many kinds of semiconductor QDs in UV-visible range are not observed in the THz regime. This indicates an insignificant contribution of strong quantum confinement here. Based on the modified Drude-Smith formula, we show that the optical excitation/pump of a CW laser can induce photogenerated carriers and enhance the effects of weak carrier confinement in BP-QDs. Thus, a nonlinear enhancement of THz absorption can be observed by increasing the power of the excitation laser. These results not only deepen our understanding of the fundamental physics of BP nanomaterials but also provide an alternative approach to realize active control of BP-based THz devices.",

    "abstract": "We experimentally investigated the asymmetric dual-grating-gate plasmonic terahertz (THz) detector based on an InGaAs-channel high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) in the gate-readout configuration. Throughout the THz pulse detection measurement on the fabricated device, we discovered a new detection mechanism called the \"3D rectification effect\" at the positive gate bias application, which is a cooperative effect of the plasmonic nonlinearities in the channel with the diode nonlinearity in the heterobarrier between the InGaAs channel layer and the InAlAs spacer/carrier-supply/barrier layers, resulting in a giant enhancement of the detector responsivity. We also found that an undesired long-tail waveform observed on the temporal pulse photoresponse of the device is due to trapping of carriers to the donor levels in the silicon <i>δ</i>-doped carrier-supply layer when they tunnel through the barrier to the gate and can be eliminated completely by introducing the so-called inverted-HEMT structure. The internal current responsivity and noise-equivalent power are estimated to be 0.49 A/W (with the equivalent voltage responsivity of 4.9 kV/W with a high output impedance of 10 kΩ) and 196 pW/√Hz at 0.8 THz. These results pave the way towards the application of the plasmonic THz detectors to beyond-5G THz wireless communication systems.",

    "abstract": "Imaging phenotypes extracted via radiomics of magnetic resonance imaging have shown great potential in predicting the treatment response in breast cancer patients after administering neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Understanding the causal relationships between the treatment response and Imaging phenotypes, Clinical information, and Molecular (ICM) features are critical in guiding treatment strategies and management plans. Counterfactual explanations provide an interpretable approach to generating causal inference. However, existing approaches are either computationally prohibitive for high dimensional problems, generate unrealistic counterfactuals, or confound the effects of causal features by changing multiple features simultaneously. This paper proposes a new method called Sparse CounteRGAN (SCGAN) for generating counterfactual instances to reveal causal relationships between ICM features and the treatment response after NST. The generative approach learns the distribution of the original instances and, therefore, ensures that the new instances are realistic. We propose dropout training of the discriminator to promote sparsity and introduce a diversity term in the loss function to maximize the distances among generated counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, followed by the breast cancer dataset, and compare their performance with existing methods in the literature. Results show that SCGAN generates sparse and diverse counterfactual instances that also achieve plausibility and feasibility, making it a valuable tool for understanding the causal relationships between ICM features and treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Considering the individual differences between neurons, the fractional-order framework is introduced, and the neurons with various orders denote the individual differences during the cell differentiation. In this paper, the fractional-order FithzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neural circuit is used to reproduce the firing patterns. In addition, an energy balance strategy is applied to determine the inter-neuronal communication. The neurons with energy imbalance exchange the information whereas the synaptic channels are blocked when energy balance is achieved. Two neurons coupled by this strategy achieve the phase synchronization and phase lock, and it indicates the two neurons generate spiking at the same time or with an interval. Similarly, the synchronization results are also obtained in the chain neuronal network, and the neurons exhibit the same firing patterns since the synchronization factor is closed to 1. Particularly, the neurons with order diversities lead to the heterogeneity and gradient field in the regular network, and the target wave is developed over time. With the wave spreading in the network, the silent states and exciting states appear in the whole network. The formation and diffusion of the target wave reveals the information transmission in neuronal network, and it indicates the individual differences paly an essential role in the collective behavior of neurons.",

    "abstract": "Abstinence self-efficacy, belief in one's ability to abstain, has been identified as a predictor of substance use behavior change. Yet, many people who use substances do not want to abstain. Self-efficacy for achieving a range of goals (i.e., abstinence or harm reduction) would be more widely applicable and might also predict substance use behavior change. The current study reports on the development of the Harm Reduction Self-Efficacy Scale (HRSES), adapted from the Situational Confidence Questionnaire and other measures of behavioral regulation, to assess one's self-efficacy to limit their substance use consistent with their own substance use goals. Participants were recruited from online support groups for individuals with varied personal goals for substance use. The current primary analyses included 226 individuals who completed the HRSES. Using exploratory factor analysis, we found support for a 4-factor solution reflecting self-efficacy in different situations that might promote substance use: negative emotions and situations, positive social situations, low self-regulation, and pleasant emotions. Each subscale was generally negatively correlated with substance use and positively correlated with quality of life, indicating greater self-efficacy was associated with less substance use and greater quality of life. Additional work is needed to test the psychometric properties of the HRSES, particularly confirmation of the factor structure in larger and more racially and ethnically diverse samples. The HRSES has promising psychometric properties and high clinical utility with wider applicability to a range of substance use goals.",

    "abstract": "Massive hemorrhage calls for massive transfusions (MTs) to maintain adequate hemostasis. Massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) are the appropriate treatment strategy for such patients replacing conventional use of crystalloids. These help in standardizing and optimizing the delivery of blood components in a well-balanced ratio. The aim of the study is to propose an ideal ratio of blood components for MTP after assessing relationship between ratios of blood components transfused and mortality. MT was defined as receiving >4 packed red blood cell (PRBC) units within 1 h with the anticipation of continued need for blood products. All MT patients above 13 years of age regardless of cause of bleed were included in the study from December 2015 to October 2017 accounting for a total of 61 patients. Subgroup categorization of study population was done, and physician-driven ratios of the blood components were calculated for each case. The ratios were grouped as high (>1), equal (=1), and low (<1) ratios of fresh frozen plasma (FFP):PRBC and platelet: PRBC, and the relationship of these ratios to the clinical outcome in terms of mortality was examined. Sixty-one patients underwent MT of which the overall hospital mortality rate was 8.1% with 100% mortality among patients with penetrating trauma followed by 25% with gastrointestinal bleed. Emergency admission was an independent risk factor for mortality. Hypotension before the initiation of MT was detrimental for survival. Efficient communication existed between the treating physicians and transfusion. Majority of survivors received equal ratios of FFP: PRBC and platelet: PRBC, and all nonsurvivors received low ratios of FFP: PRBC. Analysis was statistically indicating better survival with 1:1:1 ratio of PRBC: FFP: platelet. The need of the hour is to establish an institutional MTP and ensure compliance with the same. A prospective randomized controlled trial needs to be done to overcome the limitations and confounders of the present study and establish a universal protocol.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objective</b>  Sellar repair techniques with varying complexity and effectiveness have been employed to reduce the incidence of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks following endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. This study describes our institutional experience with a minimalistic, highly effective approach to sellar repair. <b>Methods</b>  The authors performed a retrospective review of consecutive cases of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery performed at our institution. All included subjects underwent sellar repair with an epidural interlay graft. Relationships between patient and tumor characteristics, incidence of CSF leak, adjunct repair techniques, and endocrine outcomes were examined. <b>Results</b>  Three hundred and thirty-four (334) cases were included. Intraoperative CSF leak was encountered in 116 cases (34.7%), and postoperative CSF leak occurred only once (0.3%) early in the series. Seventy intraoperative CSF leaks were successfully repaired with an epidural interlay alone, including 13 high-flow leaks. Our rate of fat graft use (1.2%), nasoseptal flap (3.0%), and lumbar drain placement (6.6%) in the second half of the series showed a significant decline compared with the first half, indicating increased reliance on the interlay graft over time. Our 65% functional macroadenoma remission rate compares favorably with large historical series. <b>Conclusion</b>  Simple sellar repair using an epidural interlay graft is highly effective in preventing postoperative CSF leaks, including cases of high-flow intraoperative leaks. More complex repair techniques are reserved for select high-risk cases or those with inadequate sellar bony ledges. With this technique, there has been no postoperative CSF leak at our institution in over 300 consecutive transsphenoidal pituitary surgeries.",

Considering the steric effects, the gas-phase selectivity favors an E2 pathway barely dependent on collision energies. Remarkably, base solvation steers the reaction in an effective way toward substitution at a near-thermal energy, whereas the governing high-energy events retain elimination. Chemical dynamics simulations reproduce experimental findings and uncover a crucial solute-solvent coupling in determining such competing processes. Interestingly, collision activation can tune the underlying atomistic dynamics essentially in the reactant entrance channel and cause a mechanism shift. These features for the ubiquitous competing E2/S<sub>N</sub>2 dynamics remain quite unknown, providing unique insight into reaction selectivity for complex chemical networks.",

Based on the computed tomography images of the patients with cranio-orbital fractures, three-dimensional models of the normal craniomaxillofacial models were established by segmenting them with Mimics 19.0, Geomagic Studio 12.0, and UG 12.0, respectively, to build the finite element models of titanium repair fixation and the poly-ether-ether-ketone repair fixation. The models were then simulated by Ansys 19.2, with divergent impact forces to analyze the stresses and displacements of the repair materials, as well as the internal fixation system, and to make a comparison on the stability of the distinct repair materials. The titanium mesh is stable at impact forces ≤1500 N. Furthermore, the poly-ether-ether-ketone mesh and the internal fixation system are resistant to fracture and displacement at impact forces of up to 3000 N. By simulating distinct mechanical environments, the biomechanical finite element analysis method can digitally assess the mechanical properties of cranio-orbital repair materials and objectively evaluate the stability of the repair materials and the internal fixation system.",

However, the high-cost manufacture, limited scalability, and narrow application scopes remain major impediments to radiative cooling commercialization. Here, we present a bilayer PDMS/nanoPE fabricated by an automatic film applicator for high-performance passive daytime radiative cooling. The nanoPE underlayer maximizes the reflection of sunlight and the transparent PDMS top-layer dramatically enhances the infrared emissivity of pristine nanoPE across the atmospheric transparency window (∆<i>E</i> <sub>8-13 μm</sub> = 0.85). The obtained PDMS/nanoPE simultaneously allows a high solar reflectance of 0.94 and a thermal emittance of 0.94, enabling a sub-ambient cooling of 4.5 °C with a maximum of 7.6 °C in rooftop test and a theoretical net cooling power of 65 W/m<sup>2</sup>. A distinct temperature reduction of more than 10 °C can be achieved in comparison with pristine PDMS film. Integration of the hydrophobicity, durability, robust mechanical strength, and industrial scalability, we believe this work will provide practical and efficient solutions to cooling vehicles, buildings, and the human body in a simple and low-cost manner.",

    "abstract": "Developing a biomolecular detection method that minimizes photodamage while preserving an environment suitable for biological constituents to maintain their physiological state is expected to drive new diagnostic and mechanistic breakthroughs. In addition, ultra-sensitive diagnostic platforms are needed for rapid and point-of-care technologies for various diseases. Considering this, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is proposed as a non-destructive and sensitive approach to address the limitations of fluorescence, electrochemical, and other optical detection techniques. However, to advance the applications of SERS, novel approaches that can enhance the signal of substrate materials are needed to improve reproducibility and costs associated with manufacture and scale-up. Due to their physical properties and synthesis, semiconductor-based nanostructures have gained increasing recognition as SERS substrates; however, low signal enhancements have offset their widespread adoption. To address this limitation and assess the potential for use in biological applications, zinc oxide (ZnO) was coated with different concentrations (0.01-0.1 M) of gold (Au) precursor. When crystal violet (CV) was used as a model target with the synthesized substrates, the highest enhancement was obtained with ZnO coated with 0.05 M Au precursor. This substrate was subsequently applied to differentiate exosomes derived from three cell types to provide insight into their molecular diversity. We anticipate this work will serve as a platform for colloidal hybrid SERS substrates in future bio-sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "The physiological property of mucus is an important biomarker for monitoring the human health conditions and helping understand disease development, as mucus property such as viscosity is highly correlated with inflammation and other diseases. However, it remains challenging to sense mucus viscosity using pure medical imaging. Collecting and analyzing mucus sample in vitro using flexible endoscopes and capsule endoscope robots is also challenging due to their difficulty of accessing very confined, tortuous, and small spaces, and the sample may not reflect the real mucus property. Here a novel method is proposed to enable sensing mucus viscosity in situ by wireless miniature sensors actuated by magnetic fields and tracked by medical imaging. These miniature viscosity sensors can be delivered with minimal invasion using a novel sensor delivery mechanism by controlling a magnetically actuated millimeter-scale soft climbing robot. As the soft robot can access confined and narrow spaces, and reliably deploy the sensor on soft tissue surfaces, multiple sensors can be delivered on soft biological tissues to sense biofluid viscosity spatiotemporally. The proposed minimally invasive robotic delivery and viscosity sensing method thus paves the way toward sensing biofluid properties deep inside the body for future disease monitoring and early diagnosis functions.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic abdominal wall hernia is a rare presentation, most commonly reported in the context of motor vehicle accidents and associated with blunt abdominal injuries and handlebar injuries in the pediatric population. A 13-year-old boy presented with multiple traumatic injuries and hemodynamic instability after a high-speed motor vehicle accident. His injuries consisted of massive traumatic abdominal wall hernia (grade 4) with bowel injury and perforation, blunt aortic injury, a Chance fracture, hemopneumothorax, and a humeral shaft fracture. Initial surgical management included partial resection of the terminal ileum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon. Laparostomy was managed with negative pressure wound therapy. The patient underwent skin-only primary closure of the abdominal wall and required multiple returns to theatre for debridement, dressing changes, and repair of other injuries. Various surgical management options for abdominal wall closure were considered. In total, he underwent 36 procedures. The multiple injuries had competing management aims, which required close collaboration between specialist clinicians to form an individualized management plan. The severity and complexity of this injury was of a scale not previously experienced by many clinicians and benefited from intrahospital and interhospital specialist collaboration. The ideal aim of primary surgical repair was not possible in this case of a giant abdominal wall defect.",

    "title": "Forever young: China's migration regime and age patterns.",
    "abstract": "Chinese institutional arrangements, particularly the <i>hukou</i> system, hinder long-term settlement of internal migrants by limiting their access to social benefits. This article proposes a new method for assessing migrant settlement: the use of age data to investigate the link between migrant \"flow\" and \"stock\". We contend that migrants' inability to settle mainly derives from two sources: the difficulties in maintaining migrant family togetherness, and the impediments to long-term residence of migrants themselves. Age-related indices were developed to compare China's internal migration with other countries' internal and international migration. The results indicate a \"China difference\" in migration age patterns - child and elderly dependents of migrant workers are discouraged from migrating, while migrants growing old tend to return to the origins than to remain in the destinations. Consequently, family togetherness and long-term residence in the destinations are often unachievable for migrants. Our analyses highlight China's unique migrant labor regime, where temporary migrant workers are continuously \"recycled\" to keep destinations' workforce \"forever young\", reducing production costs of Chinese goods in global markets. Methodologically, our age-based \"mobile-to-settled\" transition framework and \"settlement rate\" of migrants in the transition are of value in examining migrant settlement chances more generally, applicable to internal and international migration beyond China.",

    "title": "Identification of cancer driver mutations in liquid-based cytology samples for the screening of endometrial diseases.",
    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women and early detection is crucial for its successful treatment. We previously showed that cytological examination combined with genetic analysis using liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples improved the diagnostic sensitivity of EC. Among 218 individuals who underwent endometrial screening by LBC, 208 samples were analysed by cancer-panel sequencing. Excluding 13 samples with low sequence coverage, we further analysed 195 samples. Among the 195 women analysed, 39 and 15 were eventually shown to suffer from malignant endometrial and non-endometrial neoplasms, respectively. Driver mutation(s) were found in nine of the 15 cytology-negative patients with endometrial malignancy, corroborating that combination of cytological and genetic analyses should increase the sensitivity of the diagnosis of malignant endometrial neoplasms. Importantly, driver alterations were found in 32 of 125 women without malignant or premalignant diseases, which raises caution for the interpretation of genetic alterations detected in the endometrial samples. Comparison between the driver mutations in the 32 subjects and those in the 29 endometrial malignancies unveiled that the number of mutations and mutations in PTEN, CTNNB1, and TP53 may be applied for the assessment and prediction of development of EC. The genetic analysis combined with liquid-based cytology is useful to improve the diagnostic sensitivity of endometrial neoplasms. However, caution must be taken when cancer-associated mutation(s) are detected in the genetic analysis. Further investigation may clarify the risk of malignant endometrial neoplasms in women with driver mutation(s).",

    "abstract": "Kerr resonators generate stable frequency combs and ultrashort pulses with applications in telecommunications, biomedicine, and metrology. Chirped pulse solitons recently observed in normal dispersion Kerr resonators with an intracavity spectral filter can enable new material design freedom, reduced fabrication requirements, and the potential for improved ultrashort pulse peak powers. This study examines the design and formation properties of chirped-pulse Kerr solitons essential for enabling these advances. First, prior theoretical predictions that chirped pulse solitons are relatively insensitive to cavity loss and the strength of the dispersion map are experimentally validated. The loss insensitivity property is applied toward demonstrating high energy pulses in a cavity with large output coupling and the map insensitivity property is applied toward demonstrating femtosecond pulses, for the first time from chirped-pulse solitons, in a dispersion-mapped cavity with small net-normal dispersion. The relationship between chirped pulses and bright pulses enabled by higher order dispersion is examined with respect to pulse formation, cavity design parameters, and performance properties. Finally, guidelines for additional improvements are detailed for chirped pulse soliton-based high-performance pulse generation.",

This study aims to describe children with <i>H. pylori</i> infection and compare the clinicopathological features of children with resolved and persistent infection. This is a retrospective review of all children with biopsy-proven <i>H. pylori</i> infection over a 6-year period. Hospital electronic files, endoscopic database, and histopathology database were reviewed. Patients who underwent follow-up endoscopy were identified, and their data was compared. A total of 176 patients were identified, of whom 100 (56.2%) were females. The average age at presentation was 10.2 years (range: 2.5-17 years). Children older than 10 years were the most affected age group. The most commonly presenting symptom was recurrent abdominal pain (92 (51.69%)), followed by epigastric pain/dyspepsia and vomiting (44 (24.72%) and 18 (10.11%), respectively). The most common macroscopic feature was antral nodularity (76 (42.70%)). The most prevalent microscopic findings were moderate inflammation of moderate chronicity. None of the patients developed gastric atrophy. Forty-four (23.5%) patients had comorbid diseases. On follow-up, upper endoscopy was available for 42 (23.59%) patients. The resolution of <i>H. pylori</i> based on histological examination was observed in only 10 (23.81%) patients. Children whose infections resolved were older. A significant number of children with biopsy-proven <i>H. pylori</i> infection presented with abdominal pain. Female gender, older age, and less severe macroscopic and microscopic findings may be associated with a higher chance of infection resolution.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which was first reported in early January 2020, continues to devastate the worlds public health system. Herein, we report on the development of a novel metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) and electrochemical biosensor for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. To develop the MEF biosensor, SiO<sub>2</sub>-coated Si-doped ZnSeS quantum dots (QDs) were newly synthesized and conjugated to an aptamer-molecular beacon (Apta-MB) probe. Thereafter, cationic AuNPs, used as a localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) signal amplifier, were self-assembled on the QDs-Apta-MB conjugate to form a QDs-Apta-MB-AuNP probe. To develop the electrochemical biosensor, the QDs-Apta-MB assay was carried out on a carbon nanofiber-modified screen-printed carbon electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to characterize the electrode surface whilst spectrophotometric, spectroscopic, fluorescence polarization and electron microscopic techniques were used to characterize the materials. Under optimal experimental conditions, the QDs binding to the Apta-MB, quenched the QDs' fluorescence and with SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding to the Apta-MB, LSPR signal from cationic AuNPs of different sizes and shapes were used to tune the fluorescence signal to obtain enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, using [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]/K<sup>3-</sup>/<sup>4-</sup> buffered with NaAc-KAc-TrizmaAc-KSCN-Borax as the electrolyte solution, anodic peaks of the QDs from the CV and DPV plots were unravelled. Electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was accomplished by a systematic increase in the QDs anodic peak current generated from the DPV plots. The limits of detection obtained for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were 8.9 fg/mL for the QDs-Apta-MB-AuNP MEF probe and ∼0.5 pg/mL for the QDs-Apta-MB electrochemical probe. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in saliva was demonstrated using the QDs-Apta-MB-AuNP MEF probe.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the neural changes that accompany sign language learning by hearing adults. We used ERPs and a word-sign matching task to assess how learning impacted the N400 priming effect (reduced negativity for translations compared to unrelated trials). English monolinguals (N = 32) learned 100 ASL signs - half highly iconic (meaning was guessable), half non-iconic. In contrast to non-iconic signs, little learning was needed for the highly iconic signs as translation accuracy was similar pre- and post-learning. Prior to learning, an N400 priming effect was observed only for iconic signs. After learning, the size of the priming effect increased for non-iconic signs (replicating word learning studies) but decreased for iconic signs. For deaf ASL signers (N = 20), iconicity did not modulate the size of the N400 priming effect. We conclude that the impact of iconicity on lexico-semantic processing is reduced following learning, as signs are integrated into an emerging visual-manual lexicon.",

Although association of iron deficiency (ID) as well as thyroid disorder has been evaluated in females, this is still an untouched topic as far as male pattern hair loss (MPHL) is concerned. This study tries to establish if any association of MPHL with ID and thyroid dysfunction. This case-control study comprised 30 consecutive cases of MPHL and equal numbers of age-matched healthy controls attending dermatology outdoor department at a tertiary care hospital. Cases as well as controls were evaluated and screened for the levels of serum ferritin (SF) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Value of SF (8-388 ng/mL) and TSH (0.358-3.7 uIU/mL) was used as standardized reference. In cases of AGA, SF level varied from 6.00 to 212.09 ng/mL (mean - 88.30 ng/mL). Whereas controls showed SF levels ranging between 23.67 and 185.05 ng/mL (mean 78.69 ng/mL). The range of TSH level in the case group was 0.379-5.078 uIU/L (mean 2.25 uIU/L), respectively, whereas control group showed serum TSH levels ranging between 0.30 and 4.30 uIU/L (mean - 1.78 uIU/L). Statistically considering two samples of equal variance <i>P</i> (2-tailed) for SF level was found to be 0.424, whereas 0.085 in case of TSH level depicting insignificant association. Spearman's correlations (<i>P</i> = 0.244) between alopecia grade and SF level were found to be statistically insignificant (<i>P</i> = 0.193). Similarly, the <i>P</i> value calculated for the alopecia grade and serum TSH was 0.784, making the correlation between alopecia and serum TSH as insignificant. The study found no statistically significant difference in the SF level and TSH level of the cases as compared to controls.",

A fundamental goal of these studies is the development of statistical techniques that can identify disease genomic signatures across multiple patient groups defined by different experimental or biological conditions. We propose <i>BayesDiff</i>, a nonparametric Bayesian approach for differential analysis relying on a novel class of first order mixture models called the Sticky Pitman-Yor process or two-restaurant two-cuisine franchise (2R2CF). The BayesDiff methodology flexibly utilizes information from all CpG sites or biomarker probes, adaptively accommodates any serial dependence due to the widely varying inter-probe distances, and makes posterior inferences about the differential genomic signature of patient groups. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the BayesDiff procedure relative to existing statistical techniques for differential DNA methylation. The methodology is applied to analyze a gastrointestinal (GI) cancer dataset exhibiting serial correlation and complex interaction patterns. The results support and complement known aspects of DNA methylation and gene association in upper GI cancers.",

In-situ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> formation data were obtained using a high-resolution chemical ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and the simulated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> concentrations calculated using updated parameters for the MCM model exhibited good agreement with observations. In the simulation analysis of different reaction pathways involved in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> formation, hydroxyl radicals were found to dominate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> production during the daytime, while olefin ozone oxidation contributed up to 65% of total H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> production during the night-time. A sensitivity analysis of the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> production parameters has revealed a high sensitivity to changes in sulfur dioxide, and a relatively high sensitivity to olefins with fast ozonolysis reaction rates and bimolecular reaction rates of resulting stabilized Criegee Intermediates. A high relative humidity promotes daytime H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> formation, but has an inhibiting effect during the night-time due to the different dominant reaction pathways.",

Footprints of the trackway were ∼46 mm deep, 272-300 mm wide and 260-294 mm in length. An associated separate footprint was 448 mm wide and 285 mm long. Cosmogenic nuclide dating of adjacent overlying beds from the same formation establishes a mean minimum age of burial age for the tracks of 3.57 Ma (+1.62/-1.18 Ma) with a mode of 2.9 Ma, which we interpret to be Late Pliocene, with a conservative age range of Pliocene to Early Pleistocene. The trackway maker is identified as a moa from the Emeidae family, probably from the genus <i>Pachyornis</i>, with a mean mass of 84.61 kg that was travelling at a speed of 2.61 kmh<sup>-1</sup>. The single adjacent footprint was made by an individual from the family Dinornithidae, most likely from the genus <i>Dinornis</i> with an estimated mass of 158 kg.

Data from 1,673 7<sup>th</sup> - 12<sup>th</sup> grade students attending 45 reservation-area schools throughout the U.S. who reported using alcohol and/or cannabis in the past year were used to identify the latent classes.

Multinomial regression showed higher grade, identifying as multiethnic, and being female were associated with higher likelihood of membership in the SCA class. AI adolescents were more likely to be classified in the Primarily Cannabis Use class as compared to all other classes. Characterizing profiles of use may help identify those engaging in risky or co-use and help researchers and clinicians better understand how AI adolescents engage with alcohol and marijuana.",

Gig work challenges that occur in the platform environment are namely the <i>newbie challenge</i>, the <i>positionin</i>g <i>and relational challenge</i>, and the <i>balancing challenge</i>, which workers need to overcome in order to transition to the next stage. In line with contemporary career and protean career theory on career learning cycles, gig workers need to build a set of specialized skills and meta-competencies to successfully navigate their careers. As an outcome of the here-described career learning cycle, gig workers develop an entrepreneurial identity aspiration, as they are empowered and can use the platform as a playground or stepping stone for entrepreneurial activities. Our paper, thus, develops an understanding of gig workers' initial career learning cycle by examining the factors that enable gig workers to kick off a career and allow them to thrive and advance on the platforms professionally.",

    "title": "Association between Arsenic Methylation in Early Pregnancy and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Prospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "The metabolism of arsenic (As) plays a crucial role in its health effects. However, the impact of arsenic methylation during early pregnancy on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations between As methylation in the first and second trimesters and the incidence of GDM by conducting a prospective cohort study in Chongqing, China. Urine samples from first (<i>n</i> = 131) and second (<i>n</i> = 53) trimester pregnant women were analyzed for arsenite (As<sup>III</sup>), arsenate (As<sup>V</sup>), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) concentrations. Logistic regressions assessed associations between the concentrations of As species, methylation indices, and GDM risk. As species concentrations showed no significant differences between GDM and non-GDM groups. Higher MMA% (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.22) and lower secondary methylation index (SMI) (OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.71, 0.93) correlated with GDM risk, primarily in the first trimester. MMA% decreased and DMA% and SMI increased from the first to the second trimester. Results of stratified analyses revealed these associations in women under 28 or with normal BMIs (18-24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The study underscores inefficient arsenic methylation as a GDM risk, modified by age and BMI, with the first trimester as a critical period.",

    "abstract": "Alternating hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism is a rare phenomenon, especially among pediatric patients. It is usually related to simultaneous, unbalanced presence of stimulating and blocking thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAbs). Herein we describe thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone fluctuations in an adolescent boy with negative TRAbs. A 12-year-old healthy boy exhibited alternating thyroid function, with several switches between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism during almost six years of follow-up. He had persistently elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies, while TRAbs were repetitively negative. Due to a mild clinical presentation, most of the time he did not require any medication. This case contributes to the spectrum of alternating hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in the pediatric age and raises the question of mechanisms involved in fluctuating thyroid function. Therapeutic decisions should be individualized and guided by clinical manifestations and thyroid function tests, irrespective of the underlying pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Controlling coherent light-matter interactions in semiconductor microcavities is at the heart of the next-generation solid-state polaritonic devices. Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are potential materials for room-temperature polaritonics owing to their high exciton oscillator strengths and large exciton binding energies. Herein, we report on strong exciton-photon coupling in the micro-platelet and micro-ribbon shaped methylammonium lead bromide single crystals. Owing to high crystallinity and large refractive index, the as-grown perovskite microcrystals serve as self-hybridized optical microcavities along different orientations due to their distinct physical dimensionalities. In this regard, the perovskite micro-platelet forms a simple Fabry-Perot microcavity in out-of-plane orientation, while the micro-ribbon functions as a Fabry-Perot type waveguide microcavity within the plane of the perovskite sample. Consequently, excitons in these microcavities strongly interact with their corresponding uncoupled cavity modes, yielding multimode exciton-polaritons with Rabi splitting energies ∼205 and 235 meV for micro-platelet and micro-ribbon geometry, respectively. Furthermore, micro-ribbon geometry displays Young's double-slit-like interference patterns, which together with the numerical simulation readily reveals the parity and the mode order of the uncoupled cavity modes. Thus, our results not only shed light on strong exciton-photon coupling in various morphologies of methylammonium lead bromide microcrystals but also open an avenue for advanced polaritonic devices.",

    "title": "Transgender and non-binary people's perception of their healthcare in relation to endometriosis.",
    "abstract": "Endometriosis is described as a gynecological disease that can severely impact on people's quality of life. Much of endometriosis research and literature is focused on cis women, although gender diverse people and cis men have been diagnosed with this disease. Cis women have reported problems in their healthcare for endometriosis due to delays in diagnosis and a lack of support in their treatment. Gender diverse people have reported to experience discrimination in healthcare settings. There is a lack of research on gender diverse people's experience of living with endometriosis and little is known about their experience of healthcare for endometriosis. Our aim in this article is to report on the healthcare experiences of transgender and non-binary people with endometriosis. We used a phenomenological lens to explore the experiences of transgender and non-binary people with endometriosis' perceptions of healthcare. Eleven participants were recruited through social media internationally. We recruited participants that identified as transgender and/or non-binary, had suspected/diagnosed endometriosis and were 18 years old or older. Participants took part in three online semi-structured interviews and completed a diary for three months. We used Hermeneutic Analysis to analyze the data <i>via</i> themes. Phenomenology of embodiment was used as a theoretical point of departure in understanding the data. From the analysis, the following themes were created that captured participants' healthcare experiences: (1) Medical Gaslighting of Endometriosis and Gender Diverse Experiences, (2) Misgendering and Gendered Language, (3) Medical Discrimination, and (4) Validating Experiences with Health Care Providers (HCPs) and Recommendations by Participants. The findings revealed that medical gaslighting, misgendering and experiences of discrimination in healthcare settings had a psychological effect on participants, with reports of dysphoria, self-doubt, fear and a trauma response. Experiences of medical gaslighting, misgendering and discrimination in the healthcare of endometriosis may limit communication between HCPs and patients through limited treatment options being communicated, assumptions in healthcare and participants not feeling safe to disclose their gender identity for a disease that already from cis women's reports has difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. This highlights additional barriers for gender diverse people to overcome in their healthcare for endometriosis. We recommend that HCPs may benefit from further awareness and training with working with gender diverse people with endometriosis.",

    "title": "Getting to grips with resilience: Toward large-scale phenotyping of this complex trait.",
    "abstract": "The capacity of animals to cope with environmental perturbations, hereafter called resilience, is an increasingly important trait. Resilience at the level of the animal is an emergent property of multiple underlying mechanisms (physiological, immunological, behavioral). This means that there is no direct measure of resilience, no easy key traits. Resilience is a latent variable that may be inferred from multivariate measures. Further, the flexibility that resilience provides is evidenced in the rate of response to, and rate of recovery from, the environmental perturbation. Thus, it requires time-series measurements. The increasing availability of on-farm precision livestock technologies, which are capable of providing time-series measures of performance and of various physiological and health biomarkers, offer the opportunity to move toward large-scale phenotyping of resilience. There have been numerous studies putting forward methods to quantify resilience. These methods can be classified as being data driven or concept driven. However, new candidate resilience proxies need to be validated. This is tricky to do because there is no direct measure of resilience, no easy gold standard measure. Per definition, good resilience will benefit the animal. Thus, the accumulated consequences of resilience can be used to evaluate resilience proxies. All other things being equal, it is expected that good resilience will be associated with a longer functional longevity (longevity adjusted for production level), with more reproductive cycles, and with fewer disease events. Recent examples of this approach of evaluating resilience proxies against the accumulated consequences of resilience are discussed. They show clearly that operational resilience proxies that are heritable and have been validated against the consequences of good resilience can be derived from on-farm time-series data. With the aim of deriving more nuanced phenotypes, there are an increasing number of studies that have taken up the challenge of attempting to statistically combine the information coming from multiple time-series measures. These studies show how multivariate time-series statistics can be used to derive more nuanced resilience phenotypes that capture some of the underlying mechanisms of resilience. In conclusion, the recent studies reviewed here have shown that operational and heritable resilience proxies exist, that they can form the basis for selection for resilience, and that more nuanced phenotypes are attainable, which will allow selection for resilience to be tailored according to prevailing environmental challenge types.",

We refer to children who have socially transitioned as transgender children. In a prospective sample of children who socially transitioned during childhood (at or before the age of 12; <i>M</i> <sub><i>age of transition</i></sub> = 6.82), we tested whether the parent-reported internalizing symptoms of transgender children were different before vs. after they socially transitioned. The children were predominantly white (70.6% white) and girls (76.5% transgender girls, 23.5% transgender boys). Their parents tended to have high levels of education (74.5% Bachelor's degree or above) and lived in families with high household incomes (62.7% with household incomes of $75,000 or above). On average, youth showed lower levels of internalizing symptoms after socially transitioning vs. before, suggesting a possible mental health benefit of these transitions.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting was not something I had aspired to do; however, when I realised that there was a genuine scarcity for people in need of such services, I made a conscious decision to work as a freelance interpreter. The translation and interpreting service operates through various methods, such as face-to-face, video interpreting or remote interpreting by phone, depending on the need and the availability of both the user and the service provider. Usually, the doctors and other healthcare staff who work in the National Health Service book the interpreters through various interpreting companies, if patients are unable to speak the English language to express themselves. Despite immense effort, many times, staff cannot find interpreters for the patients; hence, I feel that awareness should be made so that people can come forward to use their language skills to help those people who require it. Having a medical degree helped me and instilled in me a better understanding, which is why I consciously give my free time to this service. In this article, I have tried to share my experience, so that people can derive a better understanding regarding the interpreting service in the UK. As an interpreter and translator of three languages, I have been working on a freelance basis for the past 3 years in the UK and am a linguist, a registered member of Chartered Institute of Language (CIOL).",

    "abstract": "Various complications of permanent pacemaker implantation have been reported. However, late pacemaker lead-related myocardial perforation rarely occurs. Conservative treatment is generally selected, if possible, but open heart surgery or catheter lead removal should be considered in symptomatic patients. We herein describe a patient who was successfully treated by pericardial repair and coverage for late pacemaker lead-related atrial perforation and pneumothorax. A woman in her 80s who had undergone permanent pacemaker implantation 2 years previously visited our hospital because of dyspnea. She had also been treated for right pneumothorax 1 year previously. A chest radiograph and computed tomography scan showed right pneumothorax and pericardial emphysema with no effusion. Because similar findings had been obtained at the previous onset of pneumothorax, we suspected delayed myocardial perforation and lung injury due to the screw-in lead in the right atrium. No myocardial bleeding, cardiac tamponade, or pacing failure was present. The cardiovascular surgeon judged that open-heart lead extraction would be difficult because of the patient's poor performance status; therefore, thoracoscopic pericardial repair with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sheet and coverage with anterior mediastinal adipose tissue was attempted to prevent recurrent pneumothorax. The patient was successfully treated without lead extraction or open heart surgery. At 1.5 years postoperatively, she had developed no recurrence of pneumothorax or pacing failure. Pericardial repair and coverage can be an effective strategy for pacemaker lead-related pneumothorax without pacing failure or bleeding.",

    "abstract": "Dengue fever is caused by any of the four serotypes of dengue viruses, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 spread by mosquito bites and is important to distinguish between them due to lack of cross-protective neutralizing antibodies for each serotype. Secondary infections also put individuals at higher risk for severe dengue illness than those who have not been previously infected. Current preferred assays include reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and ELISA. To enable on-field diagnosis of dengue serotypes, the detection process would need to be simplified or at least semi-automated. A downstream detection module was conceptualized and fabricated to detect the amplified DNA from the provided PCR mix (product) of previously developed modular microfluidic chips involving sample loading, cell lysis, RNA extraction and RT-PCR. Further, to ensure accuracy, each serotype assay necessitates a positive control, negative control and test sample, which constitutes 3 separate channels for the diagnosis of just 1 serotype. In this study, a 6-channel bi-assay microfluidic chip was designed with pre-loaded diluent and cyanine dye, sample chamber for loading, sequential fluidic sample mixing, and integrated membranes for simultaneous (6-channel) fluidic manipulation from a single actuation source. Positive samples will turn the dye from blue to violet while the negative controls will remain blue. The integrated membranes provided color contrast and facilitated the manipulation of the samples to the same line of sight for simultaneous analysis, paving the way for automated color analysis via smartphone.",

    "abstract": "End-of-rotation assessments (ERAs) completed by clinical faculty supervising medical students are an important component of medical student performance during clinical rotations. The quality and quantity of the formative and/or summative comments provided by faculty to students on ERAs vary. The goal of this study was to better understand the experiences, limitations, and barriers that may affect faculty at a single institution and its affiliated sites when completing this assessment. A qualitative study design was used, with phenomenology as the qualitative design of inquiry. Clinical faculty at 3 student rotation sites who worked with students and had filled out the electronic assessment form were asked to participate. A virtual platform was used to conduct semistructured interviews. Transcripts of the recorded interviews were reviewed and analyzed to identify emerging and recurrent themes. Eleven faculty members (8 men and 3 women) were interviewed. Most participants felt that the time spent with medical students was limited, compromising the assessment process-particularly at sites where they are assigned to inpatient service for 1 week at a time. Longer intervals between end-of-rotation and completing the assessment limited details in the narrative components. Some participants were hesitant to assign students lower scores and to write negative comments in their assessments. Although constructive comments could be provided verbally, they were not always stipulated as comments on the assessment form. Many were concerned that written comments could negatively affect a student's future career. The participants recognized the importance and benefit of writing comments specific to the individual student. Many opined that providing prewritten examples of suggested comments would result in a generic assessment. The experiences, limitations, and barriers that affected faculty members' ability to assess medical students at the end of the neurology rotation included limited time spent with students, a longer time taken to fill out the assessment form, and reluctance to write negative comments that could potentially affect a student's career. Specific comments about individual students were deemed important. Shorter and more frequent assessments, modifications to faculty schedules, faculty development initiatives, and adoption of a growth mindset are potential ways to overcome barriers faced by faculty.",

Thus, an augmented intervention for early, slow weight loss responders was implemented. This qualitative analysis explored participants' perceptions of and experiences of the 12-month weight loss programme to inform future intervention development and implementation. Individual interviews were conducted post-treatment. In-person, in-depth interviews were offered prior to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic; videoconferencing interviews were offered following the pandemic onset. A Midwestern US university workplace. Adults ⩾21 years old with overweight or obesity and prediabetes (<i>n</i> = 39) were recruited and volunteered to participate in a semi-structured interview. Content analysis identified recurring themes among early and early slow weight loss responders. Social support received during weekly group sessions was a critical intervention component. Some early slow responders expressed difficulty with self-regulatory strategies such as setting specific yet attainable goals, and requested additional contact prior to the maintenance study phase - treatment randomisation at month 5 disrupted group dynamics. Early slow responders who received the intervention via videoconferencing believed the format interfered with their ability to establish friendships with other participants and gain insight and support from others' lived experiences. Weight loss interventions may be more efficacious when considering participant heterogeneity during implementation of behavioural strategies. Findings suggest early slow weight loss responders may benefit from greater emphasis on goal setting and striving, agentic thinking, and social support. Future research is needed to examine the implications of these insights on intervention outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to tumors in children, between 6% and 20% of all brain tumors in adults arise solitary in the posterior cranial fossa. Given their rarity in adults, as well as the importance and complexity of their treatment, this paper reviews and discusses the clinical and surgical characteristics of such tumors. In a retrospective single-institution observational study, adult patients with posterior fossa tumors treated surgically over a ten-year period were analyzed. The characteristics observed were age and gender distribution, clinical symptoms, histopathologic tumor type, tumor size, location and extent of surgical resection, tumor recurrence and postoperative complications, as well as surgical outcome. Sixty-six patients who underwent surgical treatment were diagnosed with a tumor in the posterior fossa. The mean age was 63 years, and patients were evenly distributed by gender. The most common histopathologic type was metastatic tumor (59.1%), whereas meningioma was the most common primary brain tumor (16.6%) recorded. Most patients presented with vegetative and cerebellar symptoms in general and cranial nerve palsy, especially in the occurrence of vestibular schwannoma. In conclusion, posterior fossa tumors grow in a confined space and therefore may directly threaten vital centers in their immediate vicinity. Thus, it is crucial to schedule an appropriate surgical intervention as soon as possible, as it can significantly improve treatment outcome and prognosis of the disease. If possible, meticulous total tumor resection should be the treatment of choice. In the case of hydrocephalus, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt should be considered as an alternative surgical option after tumor resection.",

Most posts (90.2%) originated from Brazil, and they were predominantly shared by business profiles (94.2%). Approximately 67.2% of these posts focused on preventive dental issues, driven by noncommercial interests in 88.8% of cases. Misinformation was present in 39.6% of the posts, particularly those with a positive sentiment and commercial motivation. Business profiles and positive sentiment were identified as predictive factors for higher post engagement. These findings highlight a significant proportion of dental caries-related posts containing misinformation, especially when associated with positive emotions and commercial motivation.",

This study aims to analyze the approach to CS in Brazilian documents to promote adequate and healthy eating, in line with the political, epidemiological and social context of their publication periods, starting from the first edition of the National Food and Nutrition Policy (PNAN). Public documents included in the virtual libraries of the Secretariats of Primary Health Care and Social Development were searched, starting from the date of publication of the first PNAN edition (1999) until 2022. It was identified 25 documents; 4 themes were generated and analyzed. There was an evolution of the CS approach, expanding the focus on biological-nutritional and hygienic-sanitary aspects of cooking to an approach that takes biopsychosocial-cultural and environmental factors into account, especially after the publication of the second edition of the Brazilian Food Guidelines, which highlights the expansion of the perspective on cooking and consolidates it as a golden rule for adequate and healthy food.",

    "title": "Short-acting β<sub>2</sub>-agonist Prescription Patterns in Patients with Asthma in the Philippines: Results from SABINA III.",
    "abstract": "As asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, anti-inflammatory treatment should be positioned at the forefront of guideline-directed asthma care. However, patients tend to rely on short-acting β<sub>2</sub>-agonists (SABAs) for rapid-onset symptom relief. The impact of SABA overuse and associated clinical outcomes have been investigated extensively in Europe and North America. Limited data are available from countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. The SABA use IN Asthma (SABINA) III program, a large multicountry, observational study, was undertaken to describe the global extent of SABA use and its potential contribution to suboptimal disease control. As part of the SABINA III study, we aimed to characterize SABA prescription collection and asthma-related clinical outcomes among patients in the Philippines. This nationwide, observational, cross-sectional, SABINA III study included patients (aged ≥12 years) with a documented asthma diagnosis recruited between May 2019 and January 2020 from 10 sites in the Philippines. Demographics, disease characteristics and prescribed asthma treatments, including SABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the 12 months preceding study start, were recorded during a single visit, and transcribed onto an electronic case report form (eCRF). Patients were classified by investigator-defined asthma severity, guided by the 2017 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report and practice type, either primary or pulmonary medicine specialist care. Of 245 patients analyzed, 63.3% were classified as having moderate-to-severe asthma (GINA steps 3-5), and most patients (63.3%) were enrolled by pulmonary medicine specialists. Overall, 33.1% (n=81) of patients had experienced ≥1 severe exacerbation in the previous 12 months and 18.4% (n=45) of patients had uncontrolled asthma. With respect to asthma treatments, a total of 6.5% (n=16), 40.4% (n=99), and 2.4% (n=6) of patients were prescribed SABA monotherapy, SABA in addition to maintenance therapy, and ICS, respectively, in the 12 months prior to their study visit. Most patients (n=156 [63.7%]) received prescriptions of fixed-dose combinations of ICS and long-acting β<sub>2</sub>-agonists. SABA over-prescription, defined as ≥3 SABA canister prescriptions per year, was observed in 10.6% (n=21) of patients. Additionally, 25.6% (n=23) of patients classified as having mild asthma were prescribed either nebulized SABA (n=17) or oral SABA (n=6). Nearly one-third of patients (n=75 [30.6%]) had purchased over-the-counter (OTC) SABA, and 46.9% (n=115) were prescribed antibiotics. In this SABINA III Philippines study cohort, more than 10% of patients were over-prescribed SABA canisters. Additionally, prescriptions for oral or nebulized SABA, the purchase of non-prescription (OTC) SABA, and the high percentage of prescriptions for antibiotics warrant country-wide improvements in asthma care and management.",

Cellulose fibers were extracted from wheat straw, an agricultural waste material, whereas titania sol was prepared from titanium(IV) acetoximate, [Ti{ONC(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}<sub>4</sub>]. The synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-cellulose composite was characterized by FT-IR, SEM-EDX, and XRD analyses. The obtained results exposed that TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs were homogeneously dispersed over the surface of cellulose fibers. A study was conducted to compare the photocatalytic activities of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-cellulose composite and TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs towards the degradation of methylene blue and methyl orange dyes under sunlight, and it was observed that the photo-degradation of methylene blue (99.99%) and methyl orange (80.73%) within 160 min is higher in the presence of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-cellulose composite than TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. The adsorption capabilities of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-cellulose composite towards Pb<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, and Cr<sup>3+</sup> toxic metal ions were also examined, and it was found 44.73 mg. g<sup>-1</sup> (89.46%), 38.82 mg. g<sup>-1</sup> (77.65%), and 4.42 mg. g<sup>-1</sup> (8.85%), respectively.

    "abstract": "As a common environmental endocrine disruptor, phthalate exposure could affect the diabetes risk. However, it remains unclear whether phthalate exposure in the elderly population alters diabetes risk. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to explore the effect of urinary phthalate metabolites on diabetes in the elderly. We conducted a health survey of 200 elderly in northeastern China and measured urinary concentrations of 64 phthalate metabolites. We next evaluated the association between major phthalates and phthalate mixtures and diabetes in the elderly. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression screened for mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) as important predictors for diabetes. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian Kernel Machine regression (BKMR) models consistently found MEHHP (Weights = 51.9%, PIP = 0.97) to have the greatest effect on diabetes risk in the elderly. Furthermore, MEHHP was associated with an increased risk of diabetes in the multipollutant logistic regression model (OR = 2.148, 95% CI: 1.255 to 3.677). The overall effect of coexposure to MCPP, MEHHP, and MEP on the risk of diabetes in elderly population was significant and positive. In summary, we found that increased urinary MEHHP levels could increase the risk of diabetes in the elderly population. Co-exposure to MCPP, MEHHP and MEP may increase the risk of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to experience greater difficulties with social communication and sensory information processing. Of particular interest in ASD biomarker research is the study of visual attention, effectively quantified in eye tracking (ET) experiments. Eye tracking offers a powerful, safe, and feasible platform for gaining insights into attentional processes by measuring moment-by-moment gaze patterns in response to stimuli. Even though recording is done with millisecond granularity, analyses commonly collapse data across trials into variables such as proportion time spent looking at a region of interest (ROI). In addition, looking times in different ROIs are typically analyzed separately. We propose a novel multivariate functional outcome that carries proportion looking time information from multiple regions of interest jointly as a function of trial type, along with a novel constrained multivariate functional principal components analysis procedure to capture the variation in this outcome. The method incorporates the natural constraint that the proportion looking times from the multiple regions of interest must sum up to one. Our approach is motivated by the Activity Monitoring task, a social-attentional assay within the ET battery of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT). Application of our methods to the ABC-CT data yields new insights into dominant modes of variation of proportion looking times from multiple regions of interest for school-age children with ASD and their typically developing (TD) peers, as well as richer analysis of diagnostic group differences in social attention.",

In hospital, the mean pre- and post-ductal SpO<sub>2</sub> were 94.3% and 96.0%, respectively. In the PHNC, mean pre- and post-ductal SpO<sub>2</sub> were 94.4% and 95.6%, respectively. Desaturation episodes occurred frequently at a median rate of once every 5 minutes. The median duration of pre-ductal desaturation episodes was longer in hospital than in the PHNC for all SpO<sub>2</sub> thresholds (P < 0.05).

However, because of the complex structure of the enzyme active sites and the epistatic effects of various mutations on enzyme activity, it is difficult to design enzymes with multiple mutation sites using conventional methods. In this study, we designed multi-point mutants by fragment replacement in the donor-acceptor binding pocket of <i>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae N</i>-glycosyltransferase (ApNGT) to obtain novel properties. Candidate fragments were selected from a customized glycosyltransferase database. The stability and substrate-binding energy of the three fragment replacement mutants were calculated in comparison with wild-type ApNGT, and mutants with top-ranking stability and middle-ranking substrate-binding energy were chosen for priority experimental verification. We found that a mutant called F13, which increased the glycosylation efficiency of the natural substrate by 1.44 times, the relative conversion of UDP-galactose by 14.2 times, and the relative conversion of UDP-xylose from almost 0 to 78.6%. Most importantly, F13 mutant acquired an entirely new property, the ability to utilize UDP-glucuronic acid. On one hand, this work shows that replacing similar fragments in the donor-acceptor binding pocket of the enzyme might provide new ideas for designing mutants with new properties; on the other hand, F13 mutant is expected to play an important role in targeted drug delivery.",

The aim is to assess the quality of examinations, the status quo of the electronic examination system and the implementation of recommendations regarding the conduct of exams at the TiHo. Based on the results suitable indicators for the evaluation of examinations and items as well as adequate quality assurance measures and item formats are to be identified. For this purpose, 294 electronic examinations carried out from 2008 to 2022 of the veterinary medicine course with an average of 248 participants each were evaluated with regard to the quality criteria reliability, difficulty index, and discrimination index. The main finding was that the number of items and the proportion of reused questions were identified as factors through which the quality of the examinations can be increased with simple adjustments. A higher number of items led to better reliability, whereby the required minimum reliability in examinations of 0.8 was reliably achieved from an item number of 98 questions. The proportion of reused questions should be kept low, as these had a negative influence on the characteristic values. Measures accompanying examinations, such as training of question authors and a pre- and post-review process, should also ensure the quality of examinations. For the post-review process, the distribution of examination results, reliability, item and distractor analysis are adequate indicators for evaluating examinations.",

    "abstract": "Juveniles of interspecific avian brood parasites need to locate and recognize conspecifics to continue their life cycle after being reared by individuals of another species. However, little is known about the recognition mechanisms and cues involved in this critical stage of their lives. It has been proposed that adult parasites could show some kind of parental behavior by actively searching and interacting with conspecific young, which in turn could serve the juveniles to learn and/or reinforce the learning of conspecific characteristics. Since acoustic communication is one of the main channels used by birds, if such form of parental behavior by adult avian brood parasites does exist, adult cowbirds should recognize and respond positively to vocalizations of conspecific juveniles. We experimentally tested whether adult shiny <i>Molothrus bonariensis</i> and screaming <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i> cowbirds respond positively towards acoustic signals of conspecific juveniles using two playback experiments, one conducted in semi-captivity and the other in the field. In both cases, we presented 3 types of playbacks to adults of both cowbird species: vocalizations of shiny cowbird juveniles, vocalizations of screaming cowbird juveniles, and white noise as a control. In the experiment in semi-captivity, no significant differences were found between treatments. In the field experiment, no conspecifics approached the playback area, but hosts of the species whose playback was played were attracted to the loudspeaker. In conclusion, our results do not support the predictions we tested from the parental behavior hypothesis and indicate that adult shiny and screaming cowbirds do not respond positively to acoustic signals of conspecific juveniles, at least not to the type of signals used in our experiments.",

However, morphological measurements of insect flight are mostly available for terrestrial taxa and dragonflies, while aquatic insects have been poorly investigated. We analyzed 7 flight-related morphological parameters of 32 taxa belonging to 5 orders of emerging aquatic insects (Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Plecoptera, Diptera, and Megaloptera) with different life history traits related to flight (dispersal strategy, voltinism, adult lifespan, and swarming behavior). After correcting for allometry, we used an a priori<i>-</i>free approach to cluster the individuals according to their flight-related morphology. Then, we explored the levels of agreement between these clusters, taxonomy, and several life history traits of the taxa. All orders were scattered among several clusters, suggesting a large range of flight capacities, particularly for Diptera. We found swarming taxa in each cluster, showing that morphological adaptations to swarming are not identical in all aquatic insects. The clusters did not match the expected dispersal capacity of the taxa as derived from the literature or databases. Heavy wide-winged insects notably gathered taxa traditionally described as good or weak dispersers. Flight capacities based on morphology partly matched with the taxonomy and life-history traits of aquatic insect imagoes. Other parameters such as flight propensity, energy stores, and wing kinematics should help refine their flying and dispersal capacity.",

    "abstract": "Neyman-Scott processes (NSPs) are point process models that generate clusters of points in time or space. They are natural models for a wide range of phenomena, ranging from neural spike trains to document streams. The clustering property is achieved via a doubly stochastic formulation: first, a set of latent events is drawn from a Poisson process; then, each latent event generates a set of observed data points according to another Poisson process. This construction is similar to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models like the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in that the number of latent events (i.e. clusters) is a random variable, but the point process formulation makes the NSP especially well suited to modeling spatiotemporal data. While many specialized algorithms have been developed for DPMMs, comparatively fewer works have focused on inference in NSPs. Here, we present novel connections between NSPs and DPMMs, with the key link being a third class of Bayesian mixture models called mixture of finite mixture models (MFMMs). Leveraging this connection, we adapt the standard collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for DPMMs to enable scalable Bayesian inference on NSP models. We demonstrate the potential of Neyman-Scott processes on a variety of applications including sequence detection in neural spike trains and event detection in document streams.",

    "abstract": "The evidence links chemotherapy to cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients. This study assessed the link between subjective chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation in breast cancer patients. In a correlational study, 113 patients aged 21 to 60 years on chemotherapy regimens completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognition Test (FACT-Cog) as a measure of subjective cognitive functioning at three time points (baseline- T<sub>0</sub>, third cycle- T<sub>1</sub>, and sixth cycle- T<sub>2</sub>). The levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)) were measured using an assay method and compared with the subjective cognitive impairment. Midway through chemotherapy, higher levels of TNF-α were inversely linked with self-perceived cognitive performance, while higher levels of IL-1β were positively associated (<i>p</i> = 0.030). However, at the end of chemotherapy, only IL-8 (<i>p</i> = 0.50) was associated with higher self-perceived cognitive problems. The specific roles that various cytokines and their interactions may play in neuroinflammation or neuroprotection require further investigation.",

    "title": "A retrospective bilateral breast proton pencil beam scanning and photon volumetric arc therapy planning comparison.",
    "abstract": "Advanced bilateral breast cancers with local and regional nodal involvement are rare and challenging to plan due to conflicting demands of conformality, uniformity and sparing of organs at risk such as heart and lungs. Pencil beam scanning (PBS) protons have been shown to provide improved organ at risk (OAR) sparing, conformality and homogeneity compared to photon techniques including three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric arc therapy (VMAT), and tomotherapy. We performed a blinded comparison between VMAT and PBS plans and extend this comparison with a case study of a patient win expander <i>in situ</i> during radiotherapy. In this case-controlled study, five bilateral breast patients' clinical proton plan datasets were anonymized and replanned using VMAT. Additionally, for one patient with bilateral expanders, we compared two PBS planning techniques that are used clinically. For the similar target volume coverage, significant differences were found for heart and lung sparing, particularly for lower isodoses. For instance, mean lung V5 was 96.7% <i>vs.</i> 39% for VMAT <i>vs.</i> PBS and mean heart dose was 11.4 <i>vs.</i> 0.69 Gy (RBE) for VMAT <i>vs.</i> protons. The expander patient's plan did not differ significantly from whole breast or chest wall patients in terms of coverage or in gains from PBS compared to VMAT. For example, for comparable homogeneity indexes (HIs) of 1.2 (VMAT) and 1.1 (PBS), the mean heart dose is 11 <i>vs.</i> 1 Gy. The gains from PBS are approximately a factor of 10 compared to a factor of <2 for estimated gains to VMAT plans using deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) described in the literature. PBS provides better sparing of heart and lungs compared to VMAT in whole breast, chest wall and expander patients. Further study with more patients is required to validate these conclusions.",

    "abstract": "As PET imaging is accompanied by substantial radiation exposure and cancer risk, reducing radiation dose in PET scans is an important topic. However, low-count PET scans often suffer from high image noise, which can negatively impact image quality and diagnostic performance. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for recovering underlying signal from noisy counterparts. However, neural networks trained on a specific noise level cannot be easily generalized to other noise levels due to different noise amplitude and variances. To obtain optimal denoised results, we may need to train multiple networks using data with different noise levels. But this approach may be infeasible in reality due to limited data availability. Denoising dynamic PET images presents additional challenge due to tracer decay and continuously changing noise levels across dynamic frames. To address these issues, we propose a Unified Noise-aware Network (UNN) that combines multiple sub-networks with varying denoising power to generate optimal denoised results regardless of the input noise levels. Evaluated using large-scale data from two medical centers with different vendors, presented results showed that the UNN can consistently produce promising denoised results regardless of input noise levels, and demonstrate superior performance over networks trained on single noise level data, especially for extremely low-count data.",

    "abstract": "The emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) is a post-coital contraceptive method that prevents unintended pregnancy and is useful in specific circumstances. This study examined the awareness and use of the ECP in India, as there is scarce evidence in this area to guide policy development. This study used data from the 2005-06 (n = 124 385) and 2019-21 (n = 724 115) rounds of the National Family Health Survey of India. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were applied to explore how demographic characteristics including age, education (none, primary, secondary, higher), wealth quintile, place of residence (urban, rural), marital status, parity, desire for children, whether current pregnancy was wanted, whether the women had had an abortion in the past 5 years, and whether current use of contraceptive methods affected the likelihood of knowledge and use of ECP. In the past 15 years, knowledge of ECP has increased by 37 percentage points but still remains relatively low at 48%. Less than 1% of the sample (0.55%) used ECP. Women aged 30-34 years, from wealthier and more educated backgrounds, living in urban areas, and currently using condoms had a higher likelihood of using ECP in comparison with women from age group 15-19 years, those from the poorest backgrounds, those with no education, those living in rural areas and those not using any contraceptive method, respectively. In comparison to married women, never-married women exhibited a higher awareness of ECP but lower use. More efforts must be made to improve awareness of the ECP, especially among adolescents, those with less education, poorer women and those in rural areas. The government is taking steps to improve access to ECP, and India's female community health workers, the ASHAs, could be further supported to enhance awareness of ECP.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of Philippine National Standard PNS ISO 15189:2013 to support the medical laboratory to produce competent results is a recognised challenge. It is apparent that the approach of ensuring the equipment availability can be specifically optimised. No known research has focused on exploring on the conduct of conformity evaluation of Afinion 2 Analyzer maintainability for the PNS ISO 15189:2013 accredited medical laboratory. The aim of the current study was to develop a practical tool for the medical laboratory to support the internal audit process by determining the compliance status of Afinion 2 Analyzer maintainability. The relevant conformance requirements in Clauses 4 (Management requirements) and 5 (Technical requirements) of PNS ISO 15189:2013, manufacturer requirements and specific requirements for accreditation from 70/101 (69%) accreditation bodies in 80/249 (32%) countries were identified as specific audit criteria for Afinion 2 Analyzer conformity evaluation checklists for the maintenance and reference equipment. This study identified a total of 44/1515 (2.9%) conformance requirements and 33/1515 (2.2%) conformance requirements was associated with the hardware and software component of Afinion 2 Analyzer, respectively in Clauses 4 and 5 of PNS ISO 15189:2013. In addition, manufacturer requirements (<i>n</i> = 5) were identified relating to preventive maintenance. Further, specific requirements for accreditation for maintenance of reference equipment were identified and selected from 13/75 (17%) accreditation bodies in 26/90 (29%) countries; together these requirements were used to develop conformity evaluation of Afinion 2 Analyzer checklists (<i>n</i> = 3) and an interpretation checklist. The present study has offered a practical contribution to existing knowledge of PNS ISO 15189:2013 accreditation compliance management by providing the medical laboratory with a practicable tool to determine the conformity status of Afinion 2 Analyzer maintainability in accordance with PNS ISO 15189:2013 conformance requirements, manufacturer and specific requirements for accreditation.",

    "abstract": "Clinical reports on treatment outcomes of sternal fractures are lacking. This study details the clinical features, treatment approaches, and outcomes related to traumatic sternal fractures over a 10-year period at a single institution. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients admitted to a regional trauma center between January 2012 and December 2021. Among 7,918 patients with chest injuries, 266 were diagnosed with traumatic sternal fractures. Patient data were collected, including demographics, injury mechanisms, severity, associated injuries, sternal fracture characteristics, hospital stay duration, mortality, respiratory complications, and surgical details. Surgical indications encompassed emergency cases involving intrathoracic injuries, unstable fractures, severe dislocations, flail chest, malunion, and persistent high-grade pain. Of 266 patients with traumatic sternal fractures, 260 were included; 98 underwent surgical treatment for sternal fractures, while 162 were managed conservatively. Surgical indications ranged from intrathoracic organ or blood vessel injuries necessitating thoracotomy to unstable fractures with severe dislocations. Factors influencing surgical treatment included flail motion and rib fracture. The median length of intensive care unit stay was 5.4 days (interquartile range [IQR], 1.5-18.0 days) for the nonsurgery group and 8.6 days (IQR, 3.3-23.6 days) for the surgery group. The median length of hospital stay was 20.9 days (IQR, 9.3-48.3 days) for the nonsurgery group and 27.5 days (IQR, 17.0 to 58.0 days) for the surgery group. The between-group differences were not statistically significant. Surgical interventions were successful, with stable bone union and minimal complications. Flail motion in the presence of rib fracture was a crucial consideration for surgical intervention. Surgical treatment recommendations for sternal fractures vary based on flail chest presence, displacement degree, and rib fracture. Surgery is recommended for patients with offset-type sternal fractures with rib and segmental sternal fractures. Surgical intervention led to stable bone union and minimal complications.",

    "title": "Curriculum Innovation: Design and Implementation of Synchronous and Asynchronous Curricula to Enhance Residents' EEG Knowledge and Experience.",
    "abstract": "There is a need for structured EEG education opportunities to enhance neurology resident education. To address this need, the American Epilepsy Society (AES) supported the development and implementation of both synchronous and asynchronous EEG courses. To produce EEG curricula that enhance resident EEG learning, increase interest in EEG and improve participants' knowledge, and to ensure that courses were highly used and available to the broadest range of learners. A multi-institutional group of EEG educators developed both courses. The synchronous curriculum consisted of a mixture of brief \"mini-lectures\" and interactive small group activities with self-assessment quizzes at the start and end of the course. The online asynchronous EEG curriculum consisted of self-directed slide sets, multiple-choice self-assessment quizzes and a structured EEG self-assessment tool. Courses were evaluated using postcourse surveys, analysis of pretest and posttest data, and analysis of user data from the asynchronous curriculum. Between 2019 and 2021, 56 residents participated in the synchronous EEG courses. On the resident survey, mean Likert scores for course design, planning, and learning outcomes ranged from 4.6 to 5.0 for the in-person courses and from 3.9 to 4.5 for the virtual course. On the 24-item pretests and posttests, overall median scores increased from 60% (14.5/24) to 75% (18/24; <i>p</i> < 0.001). More than 2,300 learners completed the first submodule of the asynchronous curriculum, but only 164 completed all sections. Most of those who completed the asynchronous curriculum reported that it was effective and appropriate for resident-level learning. The AES EEG courses provide EEG learning opportunities for neurology residents beyond what is available at their home institutions. There is evidence for the effectiveness of the synchronous course, but the scope is limited to a small number of attendees. The asynchronous curriculum is more broadly available, but very few learners completed all elements. Future steps will include expansion of the in-person synchronous course and providing guidance to learners about the core and optional components of the asynchronous curriculum to increase the impact of both educational offerings.",

She was diagnosed with tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica complicated with right lower lobe nodules by chest computed tomography, bronchoscopy, and pathological examinations of the biopsy specimens. We performed lobectomy and lymphadenectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and small pulmonary lesions were diagnosed as pulmonary adenocarcinomas. At 36 months of follow-up, the patient was free from recurrence. In conclusion, tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica complicated with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma is rare, and clinicians should be aware of this possibility, particularly in patients with pulmonary malignancy and tracheal irregularities on chest imaging. Otherwise, tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica can be easily misdiagnosed as malignant invasion of the trachea.",

    "abstract": "Human activities affect bird behavior both directly and indirectly. Birds constantly regulate their behavior in response to human disturbance. Gun hunting, a major directional disturbance, puts enormous selection pressure on birds. In China, gun bans have been in place for nearly 30 years, and little hunting using guns occurs in modern cities. However, little attention has been paid to whether a history of hunting still affects the behavioral adaptations of urban birds. In this study, we compared the flight initiation distance (FID) of the Eurasian tree sparrow <i>Passer montanus</i>, Azure-winged magpie <i>Cyanopica cyanus</i>, Common hoopoe <i>Upupa epops</i> and Eurasian magpie <i>Pica pica</i> in the presence of observers with or without popguns. The Eurasian tree sparrow, Azure-winged magpie, and Eurasian magpie effectively recognized the difference between the observers, and perceived the armed observer as a greater threat, exhibiting earlier escape behavior, but this phenomenon was not found in the Common hoopoe. The different expressions in FID of experimental bird species in China cities may be affected by the different levels of recognition of hunting pressure due to different hunting histories.",

Median PST levels were similar between GDM (n = 62, 37.6%) and normal glucose-tolerant control group (n = 103, 62.4%). In the GDM group, PST level showed a significant positive correlation with fasting insulin and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In binary logistic regression analysis, PST levels did not predict the presence of GDM significantly. Positive correlation of PST with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR suggests that PST could be associated with insulin resistance. Further studies are needed as regards to the role of PST in GDM pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative acute ischemic stroke following lung resection is relatively rare, though a devastating complication. Specifically, patients undergoing left upper lung lobectomy for lung cancer are likely to develop perioperative acute ischemic stroke. A 67-year-old man underwent thoracoscopic left upper lung lobectomy for lung adenocarcinoma; he experienced sudden-onset left hemiparesis and dysarthria on the morning of the second postoperative day. Angiography revealed occlusion of the bulbs of the right internal and external carotid arteries by a giant thrombus, which could not be removed through endovascular thrombectomy. We deployed a stent at the right carotid bifurcation to foist the giant thrombus, achieving revascularization 4 h after the onset. Treatment response was assessed as good improvement with a modified Rankin scale score of 0, and the patient was discharged home 19 days after symptom onset. We present a unique case of carotid bulb thromboembolism resulting from a giant thrombus following thoracoscopic left upper lung lobectomy, for which endovascular stenting was effective.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop a Filipino translation of the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL) version 4, and determine its internal consistency and test-retest reliability. This was a cross sectional mixed methods study comprised of two parts. The first part consisted of Filipino translation of the UW-QOL version 4 questionnaire. The second part validated the internal consistency and test-retest reliability through statistical analysis. The Cronbach's coefficient was high (0.88) which denotes good internal consistency. Pearson's correlation coefficient was obtained to determine the test-retest reliability of the translated questionnaire. A p value of <0.05 indicates that the questionnaire has good test-retest reliability. The p value was high in most of the items of the questionnaire. The internal consistency of the translated questionnaire is high and comparable to other translations of the same questionnaire. The test-retest reliability is low owing to the interventions done between the test and retest.",

    "abstract": "There is currently a dearth of evidence regarding the impact of the manipulation mode on human occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) originating from e-waste dismantling. Therefore, 11 VOC metabolites (mVOCs) and four oxidative stress biomarkers (OSBs; i.e., 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-guanosine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, and dityrosine) were analyzed in urine collected from two disassembly regions. Urinary ∑mVOC concentrations were significantly higher for e-waste-related participants than controls (geometric mean: 2500 vs 1360 ng/mL; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Notably, adults from formal dismantling site (3020 ng/mL) had equivalent ∑mVOC levels as those from informal area (2830 ng/mL) but with varying composition features, indicating that elevated exposure VOC levels still remained even e-waste is properly recycled. Majority of mVOCs were significantly correlated with OSB levels occurring in nucleotides and proteins, and weighted quantile sum regression analysis further manifested that urinary metabolites of 1,3-butadiene and <i>N,N-</i>dimethylformamide occupied the highest contributions to the positive responses of measured OSBs. The hazard quotients of 1,3-butadiene and benzene were greater than one for more than 80% of participants, implying the potential health risk associated with e-waste dismantling. Thus, this study provides crucial information on e-waste-related priority VOCs of various recycling practices for management to mitigate their health risks.",

    "abstract": "Arterial hypoxemia occurs in many COVID-19 patients. Hypoxemia is one of the causes of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Main pulmonary artery dilatation and the main pulmonary artery diameter (mPAD) to ascending aorta diameter (AAD) ratio of ≥1 are significant findings regarding PH. In this study, COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients with viral respiratory tract infection were evaluated retrospectively in terms of PH. A total of 124 patients (71 male and 53 female), age range 18-85 years, were included in the study as case group and control group. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) images, blood and biochemical parameters, and demographic information were compared between the case group and control group. The normality of numerical variables was examined with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and homogeneity of the variances with Levene's test. This is the first study researching the effect of early hypoxemic stage COVID-19 infection on development of PH. As a result, it was specified that COVID-19 infection had no effects on mPAD, whereas it had a positive effect on AAD and thus led to a decrease in the mPAD/AAD ratio. Through these values, which could be easily calculated from thoracic CT images, the changes caused by COVID-19 infection on vessel diameters were put forward.",

    "abstract": "Recovery Dharma is a Buddhist-inspired mutual-aid recovery program for those with substance use disorders and behavioral addictions. The program combines meditation, emotion regulation techniques, literature, and Buddhist practices during meetings to help people achieve emotional balance and improve their well-being. Despite the growing popularity of Recovery Dharma, how the practices in this program predict recovery resources remain largely unknown. We conducted a study investigating whether practicing mindfulness and difficulty regulating emotions can predict individuals' recovery capital - a construct strongly correlated with positive recovery outcomes. Recovery Dharma members (<i>n</i> = 122; 88% White; 45% women) completed two online surveys six months apart. We conducted hierarchical linear regressions and found that mindfulness predicted unique variability in recovery capital. However, our final model that included difficulty regulating emotions explained a significantly larger portion of variability above and beyond demographic variation and mindfulness. In an exploratory analysis, we found that difficulty regulating emotions predicted recovery capital as a unidimensional construct, not any particular subconstruct. The results suggested that Recovery Dharma members' emotion regulation skills were the strongest predictor of positive recovery outcomes, surpassing demographic characteristics and mindfulness. As such, the intentional cultivation and improvements in emotion regulation skills inherent in Buddhist practices within the Recovery Dharma framework may indicate positive long-term recovery outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The spin Hall effect of light (SHEL), a microscopic and transverse splitting of linearly polarized light into circularly polarized components during refraction and reflection, can be measured at subnanometer scales using weak measurements and has emerged as a powerful candidate for precision measurements. However, despite the strong demand for compact and miniaturized sensors and precision metrology, no efforts have downsized the weak measurements. Here I demonstrate that the location of the interface where the SHEL occurs does not impact the results of weak measurements and building on this observation, propose a modified setup called the compact weak measurement to reduce the form factor by replacing one convex lens with a concave one. The concept is theoretically validated and numerically confirmed across various setup parameters and interfaces. The compact weak measurement effectively reduces the required free space distance by twice the focal length and will facilitate the implementation of SHEL-based precision measurements in practical applications.",

The amount of acrylamide generated during manufacturing was determined. The proximate content of the chips varied depending on the manufacturing method. Based on color determination, lightness was highest in freeze-dried chips and lowest in oven-baked chips. Oil-fried chips had the highest redness, yellowness, and browning index. The total polyphenol, flavonoid content, and antioxidant activities were the highest in freeze-dried chips and the lowest in oven-baked chips. Air-fried chips had the highest (746.92 µg/g) acrylamide content, while freeze-dried chips had the lowest (1.82 µg/g). Compared to other methods, freeze-drying retained the maximum bioactive compound content and antioxidant activity, leading to the lowest acrylamide formation. These findings highlight a suitable method and provide basic data for future lotus root chip manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>  We hypothesized a treatment guideline for ulna/radius nonunion after failed surgical treatment and propose to verify it in a prospective study. Herein, we report our preliminary findings and review the current trend. <b>Methods</b>  Six patients who met the criteria were retrospectively investigated, and we further categorized \"nonunion of both the radius/ulna\" into four subcategories. For hypertrophic nonunion of the radius, but with stability maintained by a plate, we only reinforced the mechanical stability of the ulna (osteosynthesis, treatment option 1). In oligo- or atrophic nonunion of the radius with stability maintained by a plate, we added cancellous or tricortical bone grafts to the radius after osteosynthesis of the ulna (treatment option 2). In the presence of definitive pseudomotion of the radius (no stability), we performed revision osteosynthesis for the radius only, without (treatment option 3) or with bone graft (treatment option 4). <b>Results</b>  Two, one, one, and two patients had corresponding treatment options of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. At a mean postoperative time of 4.3 months, all radii and ulnas showed union. At the final follow-up, clinical outcomes in terms of the range of motion and VAS (visual analog scale)/DASH (disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand) scores were satisfactory. We are currently conducting a prospective trial to verify the hypothesized guidelines. For both types of radius/ulna nonunion, first, if the stability of the radius was good, we compared the final outcomes with or without revision osteosynthesis for the radius, in addition to osteosynthesis for the ulna. Second, if stability was absent in the radius, we compared the final outcomes with or without osteosynthesis of the ulna, in addition to revision osteosynthesis of the radius. <b>Conclusions</b>  The treatment guidelines for rare nonunion after failed surgical treatment of both the distal radius/ulna were suggested according to the \"concept of stability\" based on the principles of fracture treatment. This hypothesis could be used to guide prospective studies of revision surgery for nonunion of both the radius and ulna. <b>Level of Evidence</b>  Level IV, retrospective case series.",

We examined the potential impact of racial segregation on these genomics-related outcomes among medically underserved patients. We analyzed data from a sample of 546 patients recruited from a primary care clinic in St. Louis, Missouri. Multivariable models were used to examine associations between racial composition of social environments across the life course and genomics-related knowledge, self-efficacy, perceived importance, and communication. Non-Hispanic White patients reporting multiple past White social environments had higher genetic knowledge than non-Hispanic White patients reporting one or no past White social environments (<i>P</i> = .021), Black patients reporting 1 or no past White social environments (<i>P</i> = .002), and Black patients reporting multiple past White social environments (<i>P</i> < .001). We also found that among those reporting multiple current White social environments, Black patients were more likely than non-Hispanic White patients to frequently communicate about family history with family (<i>P</i> = .003). These findings indicate that structural factors may affect understanding of genetic information and communication about family history among medically underserved patients. Targeted interventions may increase the use of genetic services among this population and reduce health inequities.",

    "abstract": "Propensity score methods have been widely adopted in observational studies, however research on propensity score-based weighting (PSW) methods in complex survey data settings is lacking, particularly for binary outcomes. We conducted a simulation study to compare eight propensity score weighting approaches for estimating treatment effects using survey weighted data. Each of the eight methods is applied to estimation of two measures of the population-level treatment effect: the population average treatment effect (PATE), and the population average treatment effect on the treated (PATT). The methods are compared in terms of mean relative bias and coverage probability under different scenarios by varying the treatment effect, degrees of model misspecification, and levels of overlap in the propensity score. The results demonstrate that the two-stage methods with predicted outcomes weighted by survey weights consistently outperform the other methods for estimating the PATT; for estimating the PATE, the best performing PSW method depends on the degree of model misspecification and propensity score overlap. When the outcome model is correctly specified, four two-stage methods produce better estimates depending on the propensity score overlap. The methods are applied to the 2015 National Health Interview Survey data to estimate the effect of provider-patient discussion about smoking on smoking cessation.",

    "abstract": "Distal biceps tendon (DBT) injuries are relatively uncommon. Controversies exist regarding the best approach, leading to variations in treatment. This study aims to understand the preferences and practices of orthopedic surgeons regarding management of DBT injuries, as well as assess the feasibility of a future pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of various surgical factors on patient outcomes. A cross-sectional international survey was conducted amongst surgeons treating patients with DBT injuries. The survey included questions about treatment preferences, surgical techniques, case volumes, and interest in participating in a future RCT. Responses from 491 orthopedic surgeons from 26 countries/territories were obtained. Most surgeons had limited exposure to DBT ruptures. Variations were observed in the work-up process, with some relying solely on clinical examinations while others used diagnostic imaging. A single incision approach was the most common surgical technique, and tendon fixation with suspensory cortical buttons was frequently preferred. Most surgeons did not explore or repair the bicipital aponeurosis. Interest in participating in a future RCT varied for different surgical controversies. This survey provides valuable insights into surgeons' preferences and practices for DBT injury management. The study highlights the need for standardization in the work-up process and the use of evidence-based guidelines. Current practices may be influenced by factors such as training, implant availability, and costs. The survey also identified surgeons and centers interested in collaboration for future multicenter trials, allowing for equitable access to surgical collaboration opportunities and addressing the lack of evidence in DBT rupture treatment.

    "abstract": "We are far from knowing all species living on the planet. Understanding biodiversity is demanding and requires time and expertise. Most groups are understudied given problems of identifying and delimiting species. DNA barcoding emerged to overcome some of the difficulties in identifying species. Its limitations derive from incomplete taxonomic knowledge and the lack of comprehensive DNA barcode libraries for so many taxonomic groups. Here, we evaluate how useful barcoding is for identifying arthropods from highly diverse leaf litter communities in the southern Appalachian Mountains (USA). We used 3 reference databases and several automated classification methods on a data set including several arthropod groups. Acari, Araneae, Collembola, Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera were well represented, showing different performances across methods and databases. Spiders performed the best, with correct identification rates to species and genus levels of ~50% across databases. Springtails performed poorly, no barcodes were identified to species or genus. Other groups showed poor to mediocre performance, from around 3% (mites) to 20% (beetles) correctly identified barcodes to species, but also with some false identifications. In general, BOLD-based identification offered the best identification results but, in all cases except spiders, performance is poor, with less than a fifth of specimens correctly identified to genus or species. Our results indicate that the soil arthropod fauna is still insufficiently documented, with many species unrepresented in DNA barcode libraries. More effort toward integrative taxonomic characterization is needed to complete our reference libraries before we can rely on DNA barcoding as a universally applicable identification method.",

The aim of this work is to offer a representative sample of facial laceration and identify the recreational activities associated with the highest risk of such injuries. We conducted a retrospective study of patients reported to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) which collects information on injuries related to consumer products. Patients were included in our dataset from the time period of 2012 to 2021 if they sustained a facial laceration that was caused by a recreational activity. Our findings reveal 2,383,761 facial lacerations between the study period examined. Young male white adults were more likely to sustain a facial laceration related to recreational activities. Injuries related to exercise equipment were also more likely seen in male patients. The most common cause of facial lacerations was associated with bicycles and basketball. This study found that young white adults are notably prone to facial lacerations, with recreational activities such as bicycling and basketball accounting for the majority of cases. Understanding these statistics is pivotal for implementing targeted strategies to prevent these injuries and their associated consequences.",

The specific characteristics of MBCs can be significantly influenced by the choice of substrates and reinforcing materials during myco-fabrication. This study aims to improve MBCs sourced from <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i> (oyster mushroom) using spent coffee grounds (SCGs) as the main substrate, combined with natural pineapple fibres (NPFs). NPFs are incorporated to SCGs in different proportions (10% to 30%) to explore their potential in improving the material properties of MBCs. The findings demonstrate that the mechanical properties of MBCs, as well as the physical and chemical properties, can be altered by manipulating the proportion of NPFs. The MBCs reinforced with 10% NPFs exhibit the highest density and compressive strength, while the MBC with 30% NPFs outperforms others in terms of bending strength, water absorption, swelling, and sound absorption. Furthermore, a fire resistance test affirms the non-combustible properties of the MBC made of SCGs and NPFs, thereby demonstrating its safety features. These MBCs, made from oyster mushroom, embody a hopeful substitute for product creation and production in relation to practical usage, eco-friendly manufacturing techniques, and recyclability throughout its lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "Infections remain an important cause of morbidity in kidney transplant recipients, particularly in the early post-transplant period. This window coincides with an increased risk of acute rejections. Prompt identification of the cause of graft dysfunction is paramount to ensure good outcomes. This case report presents a 32-year-old male undergoing his second living-related kidney transplantation, complicated by herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) nephritis. Despite favorable initial graft function, he developed odynophagia post-operatively, leading to the diagnosis of HSV-related esophageal ulcers. Subsequent acute graft dysfunction prompted biopsy, revealing HSV-2-related acute tubular injury. Prompt initiation of intravenous acyclovir resulted in graft recovery. This case underscores the importance of considering uncommon viral etiologies in post-transplant complications and highlights the role of timely diagnosis and treatment in preserving graft function.",

    "abstract": "Mixed dimensional van der Waals heterostructure based on layered two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) interfaced to gallium nitride (GaN) has attracted tremendous attention due to its unique properties and application in novel electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices. However, developing facile synthesis methods and insights into the exciton dynamics for this system still remains a major challenge. Here, a simple and cost-effective method is demonstrated for large-scale synthesis of monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> on differently doped GaN substrates. A mixed aqueous solution of Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> and NaOH is spin-coated on GaN and sulfurated in one step by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). High quality monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets with side length over 400 μm and surface coverage ratio of more than 90 % are achieved on GaN. Furthermore, the PL intensity, excitonic transition ratios and ultrafast exciton dynamics of MoS<sub>2</sub> are observed to be largely modulated by the doping type of GaN, owing to substrate-induced doping, which is proved by Raman, PL and transient absorption spectroscopy. Notably, p-GaN can attract electrons from monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> and weaken its intrinsic n-doping, thereby facilitating higher PL intensity as well as longer exciton lifetime, while n-GaN provides strong n-doping and generates opposite effect. This work hereby presents a pathway for large-scale synthesis of MoS<sub>2</sub>/GaN heterostructures and further understanding of their charge transfer properties and exciton dynamics, which should inspire their applications for optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is an inflammatory disease that results in destruction of the hair follicle and replaces it with patchy permanent scarring alopecia; after stabilizing by treatment, reactivation is common and may be insidious. During remission, various methods are available for realizing that the disease is activated or not, but neither of them is practical for patients. This study aims to evaluate the paper sign test for reactivated LPP by physician and patient. In a prospective study, during 2 years, 83 treated LPP patients have been divided into two groups of 41 and 42. Group 1 instructed for paper sign test which is to comb their hair over a white paper sheet to catch any fallen hairs, then turn the paper upside down, if all collected hair on paper completely separated, test is considered negative, if even one hair hangs onto the paper, the test is considered positive. Group 2 trained for clinical symptoms (hair shedding, scaling, itching, pain, tenderness, and burning). From the first group, 13 patients had positive paper sign, and from the second group, 35 patients had clinical symptoms; after clinical examination and biopsy, 13 from Group 1 and 17 from Group 2 were confirmed to have reactivated disease. Patients in the first group who had been trained for paper sign test became aware of relapse sooner and came earlier for the evaluation of disease. Paper sign test is a reliable, noninvasive, and practical test for early detection of reactivated LPP by patients during remission period.",

This study aimed to determine the effects of a 2-part dietary consultation, targeted at identified barriers for adherence in this population, on self-efficacy for adhering to an anti-inflammatory diet, as well as adherence and health outcomes one-month post-intervention. Eleven individuals (10 female, age 51.5±12.6 years) with neurological disability (7 multiple sclerosis, 3 spinal cord injury, 1 muscular dystrophy; 20.5 ± 10.6 years post-injury/diagnosis) participated. The intervention group (n = 7) received recipes for an anti-inflammatory diet and the consultation, while controls (n = 4) received the recipes only. The consultation included a home-visit involving cooking and accessible kitchen equipment demonstrations, and an accompanied trip to the grocery store. Task and barrier self-efficacy improved immediately following the consultation with trends for improvement one-month post-intervention. The consultation was also associated with increased dietary adherence one-month post-intervention and decreased depressive symptoms. Changes in dietary adherence (r = -.61; <i>P</i> = .045), and barrier self-efficacy (r = -.77; <i>P</i> = .009) were negatively correlated to changes in depression. Thus, a consultation targeted at barriers related to anti-inflammatory eating can improve self-efficacy for adherence as well as actual adherence and depressive symptomology one-month later.",

    "title": "The impact of socioeconomic deprivation on the prevalence of gestational diabetes: An observational study.",
    "abstract": "Approximately 3.5% of pregnancies in the United Kingdom are complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Risk factors for this mirror those contributing to type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Though socioeconomic status (SES) is presumed to contribute to GDM, evidence in the United Kingdom is limited. In this unique study, we explored the impact of SES on GDM prevalence in a London suburb population. Four thousand one hundred and sixty-three pregnant women who booked between July 2018 and March 2020 at Princess Royal University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Associations between GDM prevalence and SES trends (using multiple deprivation deciles (MDD)), and body mass index (BMI), age, ethnicity, screening uptake, birth-weights and birth outcomes, were analyzed. Patients with BMI >30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, older than 35 years, and non-Caucasian ethnicity have an increased risk of developing GDM (<i>p</i> < 0.0001, <i>p</i> < 0.0001, <i>p</i> < 0.0001, respectively). No association existed between MDD and GDM prevalence (<i>p</i>-values over 0.05). Patients with risk factors for GDM were highest in the deprived areas <i>p</i> < 0.0001. MDD 1-4 (most deprived) had the highest percentage of missed screening (15% of patients with risk factors missed screening), compared to 8% in the least deprived group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Our data surprisingly suggest that low SES did not increase the incidence of GDM, despite a higher proportion of women with risk factors for GDM living in the most deprived postcodes. However this unclear finding may be due to low screening uptake of deprived populations, and therefore lack of GDM diagnosis, or indicate that GDM is a result of a different aetiology to T2DM. Further research is needed to explore if access to screening services, lack of health education or other health inequalities were responsible for the high proportion of missed screening opportunities in deprived areas.",

    "abstract": "CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with multisystemic comorbidities. Cardiovascular involvement in CDD was shown in animal models but is yet poorly described in CDD cohorts. We identified 38 individuals with genetically confirmed CDD through the Cleveland Clinic CDD specialty clinic and matched 190 individuals with non-genetic epilepsy to them as a comparison group. Natural language processing was applied to yield Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from medical records. We conducted HPO association testing and manual chart review to explore cardiovascular comorbidities associated with CDD. We extracted 243,541 HPO terms from 30,512 medical encounters. Phenome-wide analysis confirmed well-established CDD phenotypes and identified association of tachycardia with CDD (Odds ratio 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75-9.93, <i>P</i> <sub>adj</sub> < .001). We found a 99.6-fold enrichment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in CDD encounter notes (<i>P</i> <sub>adj</sub> < .001), which led to identification of 2 cases of fetal/neonatal onset SVT previously undescribed in CDD. Tachycardia in CDD individuals was associated with the presence of other autonomic symptoms (Odds ratio 5.63, 95% CI 1.08-40.3, <i>P</i> = .038). CDD is associated with tachycardia, potentially including early-onset SVT. Alongside prospective validation studies, semiautomated genotype-phenotype analysis with matched controls is a scalable, rapid, and efficient approach for validating known and identifying novel phenotype associations.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic condition, with overlapping symptoms to those of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There has been inconsistent evidence on whether TB is a predisposing factor for developing severe COVID-19. The aim of this report is to explore whether TB influences the severity of COVID-19. COVID-19 cases at two TB sanatoria on the Thailand-Myanmar border were reviewed. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data including TB treatment and co-morbidities, were analyzed. Characteristics and COVID-19 clinical outcomes were compared between two groups of patients: TB and those without TB (the caretakers and the medical personnel). Multivariable ordered logistic regression was conducted to compare the risk of severe COVID-19 between the two groups. Between September 2021 and March 2022, 161 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed. Over half of the COVID-19 patients were infected with TB (n= 104, 64.6%), and the rest were not (n=57, 35.4%). The median (interquartile range) age was 48 (33.5-57.0) and 27 (23-33) years in the TB and in the non-TB COVID-19 patients, respectively. Before COVID-19 infection, 67.1% (106/158) of patients had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The median cycle threshold value at diagnosis was not different between TB (18.5, IQR 16.1-32.3) and non-TB patients (18.8, 15.1-30.0). Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and ageusia were more common in non-TB patients. Six patients (3.8%, 6/156) all from the TB group became severe of which five (3.2%, 5/156) required oxygen therapy. One TB patient died (1/104, 0.96%) of lung cancer. After adjustment for potential confounders, the final clinical severity was not different between the two groups (adjusted odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 0.16-12.39). TB was not associated with severe outcomes in the two TB sanatoria. The high uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and active screening could have impacted on disease progression and prevented unfavorable outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Research on side-channel leaks has long been focusing on the information exposure from a single channel (memory, network traffic, power, etc.). Less studied is the risk of learning from multiple side channels related to a target activity (e.g., website visits) even when individual channels are not informative enough for an effective attack. Although the prior research made the first step on this direction, inferring the operations of foreground apps on iOS from a set of global statistics, still less clear are how to determine the maximum information leaks from all target-related side channels on a system, what can be learnt about the target from such leaks and most importantly, how to control information leaks from the whole system, not just from an individual channel. To answer these fundamental questions, we performed the first systematic study on multi-channel inference, focusing on iOS as the first step. Our research is based upon a novel attack technique, called Mischief, which given a set of potential side channels related to a target activity (e.g., foreground apps), utilizes probabilistic search to approximate an optimal subset of the channels exposing most information, as measured by Merit Score, a metric for correlation-based feature selection. On such an optimal subset, an inference attack is modeled as a multivariate time series classification problem, so the state-of-the-art deep-learning based solution, InceptionTime in particular, can be applied to achieve the best possible outcome. Mischief is found to work effectively on today's iOS (16.2), identifying foreground apps, website visits, sensitive IoT operations (e.g., opening the door) with a high confidence, even in an open-world scenario, which demonstrates that the protection Apple puts in place against the known attack is inadequate. Also importantly, this new understanding enables us to develop more comprehensive protection, which could elevate today's side-channel research from suppressing leaks from individual channels to controlling information exposure across the whole system.",

We investigated how BTBPE causes thyroid endocrine disruption with integrated in silico, in vitro, and in vivo assays. In yeast two-hybrid and T-Screen assays, BTBPE interacted with zebrafish thyroid hormone receptors with binding energies weaker than the TR agonist-3,3',5-Triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), and disrupted thyroid function as a thyroid receptor (TR) agonist. We examined the bioconcentration, developmental toxicity, and thyroid endocrine disruption in zebrafish after a 14-day exposure to BTBPE (1, 3, 10 μg/L). Thyroxine (T4) was lower in BTBPE-treated larvae, whereas corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were higher. The gene transcription alterations along the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were observed. Furthermore, reduced locomotion suggested that BTBPE imparts developmental neurotoxicity at zebrafish early developmental stage. Establishing that BTBPE has thyroid endocrine-disrupting effects is an important step for understanding and managing BTBPE toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour (RRBs) serve an adaptive role in development. Elevated levels of RRBs beyond the early years, however, are associated with poorer outcome in language, cognition, and wellbeing, and are seen across a range of neurodevelopmental conditions. This study aimed to characterize the association of distinct RRB subtypes at two and six years of age, with internalising and externalising difficulties in a community sample of children. 485 parents reported on their child's insistence on sameness (IS) and repetitive sensory and motor (RSM) RRBs at two and six years of age using the Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire (RBQ-2). Emotional and behavioural difficulties were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at age six. Consistent with previous research, RRBs later in development better predicted emotional and behavioural difficulties at age six than RRBs earlier in development. Moreover, IS RRBs were selectively associated with internalising behaviours and RSM RRBs with externalising behaviours. Importantly, these selective associations depended on when RRBs were measured. Only IS RRBs at age six were significantly associated with internalising behaviour. By contrast, while more RSM RRBs at age six were associated with higher rates of externalising behaviours, higher rates of RSM RRBs at age two were associated with fewer externalising behaviours, adding further support to the previously reported adaptive role of RRBs in early behaviour regulation. Although there is a need for further research to provide a detailed profile of the adaptive periods for IS and RSM RRBs, the present findings support the potential utility of elevated RRBs as a signal for emotional and behavioural difficulties at age six.",

However, the amount and timing of facial fat changes in response to feminizing hormone therapy are unknown, despite being relevant to counseling and surgical planning for facial gender-affirming surgery. The authors assessed the influence of feminizing hormone therapy duration on malar and temporal fat volume. Malar and temporal fat volumes were compared using computed tomography in transfeminine patients (age, 20 to 29 years; body mass index, 18.5 to 24.9) treated with feminizing hormone therapy for less than 2 years versus 2 years or longer. Patients with previous surgical or nonsurgical facial soft-tissue interventions were excluded. Multivariable linear regressions evaluated the contribution of hormone therapy duration to malar and temporal fat volumes. A total of 45 patients were included, 30 (66.7%) treated with feminizing hormone therapy for 2 years or longer and 15 (33.3%) treated for less than 2 years (median [interquartile range], 44.5 [33.5 to 65.6] versus 15.0 [11.0 to 18.0] months; P < 0.001). Patients treated with hormone therapy for 2 years or longer demonstrated a 1.6-fold greater malar fat volume (5.5 [4.2 to 6.3] versus 3.4 [2.3 to 4.2] cm 3 ; P < 0.001) and 1.4-fold greater temporal fat volume (2.8 [2.4 to 3.6] cm 3 versus 2.0 [1.7 to 2.4] cm 3 ; P = 0.01) compared with those treated for less than 2 years. When accounting for other contributory variables, such as body mass index, skull size, and total soft-tissue depth, in multivariable linear regression models, hormone therapy duration of 2 years or longer independently predicted higher malar (β = 0.51, P < 0.001) and temporal (β = 0.32, P = 0.02) fat volumes. Feminizing hormone therapy increases malar and temporal fat volumes by approximately 2 cm 3 and 0.8 cm 3 for each area, respectively, after 2 years of treatment. Therapeutic, III.",

    "abstract": "The study analyzed the socio-environmental determination of health in five sugarcane-producing municipalities in Pernambuco. This participatory, qualitative research was conducted from January to August 2022. Workshops were held in the participating communities to build the Participatory Rural Diagnosis of protective and destructive processes of global, community, and individual socio-environmental health dimensions. The communities pointed to social inequalities, productive deregulation, environmental degradation, labor exploitation, violence, and illness as the main processes affecting the territories. Despite this, protective processes were related to the social function of land and the right to agrarian reform, family farming, solidarity and community organization ties, and individual and family self-care practices. The diagnosis points to the need to build public policies for equity, protection, and reparation of the eco-social health of territories affected by sugarcane cultivation, burdened with intense use of pesticides and burning and over-exploited labor, among other socio-environmental problems.",

Severe or even fatal neurological deficits can occur due to associated cord injury, which can result in complete quadriplegia. Computed tomography is the primary diagnostic tool, while magnetic resonance imaging is used to evaluate any associated cord injuries. These injuries can occur either directly from the injury or during transportation to the hospital if mishandled. There are two main treatment approaches: surgical fixation or external nonsurgical fixation, with various types and models of fixation devices available. In this case study, computed tomography follow-up confirmed that external fixation can yield successful results in terms of complete healing, even in cases complicated by other factors that may impede healing, such as pregnancy.",

Endoluminal vacuum therapy (EVT) has recently appeared and proven to be a useful method for anastomotic leakage. A 76-year-old man underwent aortic arch replacement for a stent graft infection after TEVAR. Persistent mediastinitis and pyothorax were observed after aortic arch replacement, and further examination revealed an esophageal-mediastinal fistula (EMF). Over-the-scope clip (OTSC<sup>®</sup>) closure was performed to treat EMF but achieved no cure. Then, the patient was referred to our hospital. First, we removed the OTSC<sup>®</sup> that interfered with the treatment using the remOVE System<sup>®</sup> and started EVT using a double-lumen elemental diet tube (W-EDT<sup>®</sup>). The vacuum sponge was affixed to the vacuum side of W-EDT<sup>®</sup>, and enteral nutrition administered through W-EDT was combined with EVT. EMF was cured 11 days after EVT, and the patient was able to feed himself. The combination of EVT and enteral nutrition feeding using W-EDT® is a successful novel procedure to treat refractory EMF.",

However, considering the uniqueness of the structure for every individual, it is often difficult to ensure one size fits all when using pressure therapy as an adjunct.

    "abstract": "In humans, early painful experiences can increase pain sensitivity later in life, but little is known regarding this phenomenon in cattle. This study assessed if a painful event early in life affects later pain sensitivity in 40-d-old calves. Holstein calves (n = 26) were randomly assigned to control or treatment conditions, blocked within sex and birth weight. At 9.5 ± 1.8 d old, treatment calves had 1 horn bud disbudded using caustic paste, whereas control calves had 1 horn sham disbudded; in both cases, multimodal pain control was provided. All calves had the contralateral horn bud disbudded using a hot iron 4 wk later, again with multimodal pain control. Mechanical nociceptive responses were assessed weekly using an algometer applied adjacent to both horn buds and on the rump, beginning 3 d before the first disbudding and ending 30 d after the second disbudding. Following the second disbudding, both groups of calves showed evidence of increased sensitivity (i.e., algometer pressure declined 3.69 ± 0.60 √N to 2.13 ± 0.70 √N) on the contralateral bud, but there was no difference between the control group and the treatment groups. An interaction between treatment and time, likely driven by treatment differences, was found on the rump when tested 5 h after the second disbudding event. These responses are not consistent with the hypothesis that an early pain experience results in increased sensitivity to later painful experiences.",

    "abstract": "Paediatric diarrhoea and malnutrition have a bidirectional relationship, which in turn augments the presence of each other. The diarrhoeal diseases in children can be prevented by using <i>oral rehydration solution</i> (ORS) and <i>oral zinc sulfate</i>. The relationship between paediatric diarrhoea treatment guidelines with the nutritional status is not yet investigated, and this study primarily aims to examine the relationship of recommended diarrhoea case management practices with paediatric undernutrition (wasting, stunting and underweight) among children aged between 0 to 59 months. Data from <i>Pakistan Demographic & Health Surveys</i> (PDHS) conducted in 2012-2013 and 2017-2018 were used in this study to investigate the relationship between paediatric diarrhoea treatment adherence with the various forms of paediatric undernutrition. Data from children with complaints of acute watery non-dysenteric diarrhoea was used in this study, whereas data from those children presented with complaints of either dysentery, and/or severe dehydration, and/or incomplete anthropometry were excluded. Children were classified as complete adherent, partial adherent and non-adherent based on ORS and oral zinc sulfate consumption. The relationship of diarrhoea case management practices with different types of nutritional status was assessed using a binomial logistic regression method. The malnutrition in children with acute non-dysenteric diarrhoea is 54.2% in 2012-2013, which decreased to 48.2% in the succeeding survey of 2017-2018. Only 6.2% (1% in 2012-2013 ~ 10% in 2017-2018) children of Pakistan received appropriate treatment for managing their diarrhoea. However, no relationship between the diarrhoea case management and paediatric undernutrition was observed. This study found did not demonstrate a significant connection of diarrhoea case management strategies with paediatric undernutrition. This highlights the complexity of addressing both diarrhoea and malnutrition in children. Future research should emphasize the identification and resolution of the multifactorial factors, which contribute to paediatric undernutrition, integrating both diarrhoea management and nutritional improvement strategies.",

    "abstract": "One in five newborns in Nairobi County, Kenya, may require inpatient neonatal care. We sought to examine referrals to and from three busy first-level referral public hospitals in Nairobi and what infrastructure and systems are available to support neonatal transport from these first-referral level hospitals to the main tertiary care center. Patient-level data of newborns over 12 months were retrospectively extracted from routinely collected patient data and examined to characterize those referred into and out of three newborn units in the study hospitals. Structural assessments using a checklist completed during hospital visits were used to describe hospitals' readiness to support newborn referral and transport. Five percent (398/7720) of the cohort studied were either referrals into study hospitals (68%, 272/398) or referrals out (32%, 126/398). Among 397 (99%) and 268 (67%) with sex and gestation documented respectively, 63% (251) were male and 44% (118) were preterm infants (<37 weeks). Among those referred in, 26% (69/272) died and 2.6% (7/272) were further referred to a tertiary-care newborn unit. Prematurity (39%) and birth asphyxia (29%) were the main in-referral reasons from 38 different health facilities, with specialist reviews (34%) predominant for out-referrals to a tertiary center. Diverse transport methods were used for referrals to study hospitals including private and public ambulances, vehicles, and guardian's arms while onward referrals to the tertiary center were done by hospital ambulances. Drugs and medical supplies required for stabilization were well available at the study sites, however, only oxygen nasal cannula, nasal prongs, and face masks were available in ambulance of hospital 3. There is a need to develop, equip and maintain a high-quality referral and newborn transport system that can support the continuum of newborn care across referral care pathways into and from first-referral level hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Sleep and circadian problems are intertwined with serious mental illness (SMI). Thus, optimizing treatments that target comorbid sleep and circadian problems and SMI is critical. Among adults with sleep and circadian problems and SMI, the present study conducted a secondary data analysis of the Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C). TranS-C targets a range of sleep and circadian problems and SMI with 15 modules, seven of which are optional. In a 'real world' sample recruited from a community setting (<i>N</i>=121, 52.07% female, 42.97% African American or Black), we aimed to (1) elucidate patterns of sleep and circadian problems that met criteria for full diagnoses and subdiagnostic symptoms across (a) the full sample and (b) SMI diagnoses, and (2) determine whether TranS-C optional modules were delivered as intended based on participants' sleep and circadian problems. Results indicated that most participants (> 85.0%) had full diagnoses or subdiagnostic symptoms of two or more sleep and circadian problems. Further, participants exhibited heterogenous comorbidities between sleep and circadian problems and SMI diagnoses. Specifically, participants with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n=50), bipolar disorder (n=35), and major depressive disorder (n=26) exhibited 25, 24, and 21 patterns of sleep and circadian comorbidity, respectively. Notably, most participants with insomnia, hypersomnia, and an advanced or delayed circadian rhythm phase disorder did <i>not</i> receive the intended TranS-C optional modules designed to target these problems. Results underscore sleep and circadian and SMI diagnostic complexity in the community. Additionally, findings reveal discrepancies between intended and 'real-world' use of treatment modules. Future research investigating clinician decision-making-particularly when treating patients with comorbidities or using modularized treatments-is needed.",

Patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit between January 2020 and March 2023 were included in this study. Indirect calorimetry was used to measure the patients' REE values. These values were subsequently compared with those estimated using predictive equations: the weight-based equation (rule of thumb, 25 kcal/kg/day), Harris-Benedict, Ireton-Jones, and the Penn State 2003 equations. A total of 27 severe trauma patients were included in this study, and 47 indirect calorimetric measurements were conducted. The weight-based equation (mean difference [MD], -28.96±303.58 kcal) and the Penn State 2003 equation (MD, -3.56±270.39 kcal) showed the closest results to REE measured by indirect calorimetry. However, the REE values estimated using the Harris-Benedict equation (MD, 156.64±276.54 kcal) and Ireton-Jones equation (MD, 250.87±332.54 kcal) displayed significant differences from those measured using indirect calorimetry. The concordance rate, which the predictive REE differs from the measured REE value within 10%, was up to 36.2%. The REE values estimated using predictive equations exhibited substantial differences from those measured via indirect calorimetry. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the REE value through indirect calorimetry in severe trauma patients.",

    "abstract": "Three years after the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in liver cirrhosis (LC) patients remain controversial. We aimed to study the safety, immunological, and clinical responses of LC patients to COVID-19 vaccination. Prospective multicentric study in adults with LC eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, without prior known infection. Patients were followed up until the timing of a booster dose, SARS-CoV-2 infection, or death. Spike-protein immunoglobulin G antibody titers for SARS-CoV-2 at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postvaccination were assessed. Antibody titers <33.8 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL were considered seronegative and <200 BAU/mL suboptimal. Postvaccination infection and its severity were registered. We included 124 LC patients, 81% males, mean aged 61 ± 10 years, with a mean follow-up of 221 ± 26 days. Alcohol was the most common (61%) cause of cirrhosis, and 7% were under immunosuppressants for autoimmune hepatitis; 69% had portal hypertension, 42% had a previous decompensation, and 21% had a Child-Pugh-Turcotte score of B/C. The type of vaccine administrated was BNT162b2 (<i>n</i> = 59, 48%), ChAdOx1nCoV-19 (<i>n</i> = 45, 36%), mRNA-1273 (<i>n</i> = 14, 11%), and Ad26.COV2.S (<i>n</i> = 6, 5%). Eighteen percent of the patients reported adverse events after vaccination, none serious. Median [Q1; Q3] antibody titers were 1,185 [280; 2,080] BAU/mL at 2 weeks, 301 [72; 1,175] BAU/mL at 3 months, and 192 [49; 656] BAU/mL at 6 months. There were seronegative and suboptimal antibody responses in 8% and 23% of the patients at 2 weeks, 16% and 38% at 3 months, and 22% and 48% at 6 months. Older age and adenovirus vector vaccines were the only factors associated with seronegative and suboptimal responses at 2 weeks and 3 months (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Eleven patients (9%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during follow-up (3.8-6.6 months postvaccination), all with mild disease. There were no differences regarding the type of vaccine, and 73% had antibody titers >200 BAU/mL at 3 months. COVID-19 vaccines in patients with LC were safe, without serious adverse events. The humoral and clinical responses were similar to the reported for the general population. Humoral response was adversely impacted by older age and adenovirus vector vaccines and unrelated to the liver disease severity.",

    "title": "Can the <i>Normic de minimis Expected Utility Theory</i> save the <i>de minimis</i> Principle?",
    "abstract": "Recently, Martin Smith defended a view he called the \"normic de minimis expected utility theory\". The basic idea is to integrate a 'normic' version of the de minimis principle into an expected utility-based decision theoretical framework. According to the de minimis principle some risks are so small (falling below a threshold) that they can be ignored. While this threshold standardly is defined in terms of some probability, the normic conception of de minimis defines this threshold in terms of abnormality. In this article, we present three independent arguments against the normic de minimis expected utility theory, focusing on its reliance on the de minimis principle.",

    "abstract": "The present research examined cultural differences in interpersonal memories and forecasts, situated in a currently salient positive or negative interpersonal context. We found that a negative focal event, compared to a positive one, led to more negative memories and forecasts of interpersonal encounters. The effect was stronger among Euro-Canadians than among Chinese. This was true regardless of whether the salient focal event was imagined or a real-life experience. Furthermore, focal thinking-the extent to which individuals think about the salient focal event-mediated cultural differences in interpersonal memories and forecasts as moderated by the focal event valence. Relational memories and forecasts positively predicted perceived relationship quality, willingness to help, and forgiveness. The findings highlight both cultural similarities and differences in interpersonal memories and forecasts, which contribute significantly to the literature on culture and relationships.",

    "abstract": "During late childhood and early adolescence, youth experience heightened stress exposure and rates of mental health disorders, emphasizing the need to investigate how youth cope with stress as a potential mechanism of risk and/or resilience. This study examined youths' age, gender, and peer-related stress exposure as moderators of the relationships among coping and anxious/depressed symptoms during this important developmental period. To sample participants with a broad range of internalizing psychopathology symptoms, a community sample of 120 older children and adolescents (46% female, M age = 12.28) was recruited through mental health clinics and a university-based study finder in a southeastern metropolitan area. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires assessing coping strategies, stress exposure, demographic information, and anxious/depressed symptoms in a cross-sectional study. Analyses included interactions among age, gender, and peer stress as predictors of youths' coping strategies and anxious/depressed symptoms. There were significant associations between age, gender, coping strategies, and symptoms, where girls reported more anxiety and depression symptoms compared to boys, and primary and secondary control coping strategy use increased with age. The findings expand upon previous studies by showing gender differences in the relation among secondary control coping and internalizing problems at different ages. Additionally, findings demonstrate that degrees of peer stress exposure show associations with disengagement coping across development, which may contribute to the onset of internalizing symptoms in older girls. Findings may be used to inform interventions by promoting the use of more adaptive forms of coping to prevent internalizing disorders in youth. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of ambulatory total hip arthroplasty (THA) is rising, but it is not appropriate for all patients. Preoperative patient selection considers medical and social factors but overlooks patients' prior level of physical function. The aim of this study was to evaluate if preoperative physical function, measured by the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test, is associated with length of stay (LOS) in patients who underwent primary THA. A retrospective study was performed using 396 patients who underwent primary THA within a 2-month period at a single institution. Regression analysis evaluated the relationship between preoperative TUG scores and hospital LOS. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to identify a cutoff TUG score associated with LOS longer than 24 hours. Univariate regression analysis of those discharged in less than 24 hours and those discharged in more than 24 hours found lower TUG scores (10.7 vs 13.7, respectively) were associated with patient discharge within 24 hours. Multivariate regression analysis showed a higher TUG score (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-0.99) was associated with decreased odds of discharge within 24 hours. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed on the entire study cohort and the ambulatory surgery group and identified TUG scores of 10.3 and 10.5 seconds, respectively, associated with LOS of less than 24 hours (OR full cohort: 3.02, 95% CI: 1.94-4.71; OR ambulatory surgery: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.90-4.60). Sensitivity and specificity were not sufficient to support the use of these cutoff scores alone in predicting LOS. Although we were unable to establish a cutoff TUG score in patients who underwent primary THA that could determine LOS of more than 24 hours, the preoperative TUG score may be useful as a tool to aid in identifying patients who may require a longer hospital LOS. Further study is needed.",

    "abstract": "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a physiological environment, they tend to adsorb proteins to form a so-called corona. A comprehensive understanding of the effect of protein corona on NPs' toxicity is required. Our previous study indicated that silica nanoparticles (SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs) exposure with different routes resulted in distinct brain damage; however, an exact molecular mechanism of protein corona on the regulation of SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-induced damages needs further investigation. SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs exposure <i>via</i> intravenous injection may encounter a protein-rich bio-matrix, which drives the adsorption of serum protein on their surface to form a stable SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs@serum complex. On the contrary, SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs exposure <i>via</i> intranasal instillation remained their original feature, due to a protein infertile environment of cerebrospinal fluid. Apparently, surface adsorption of proteinaceous substances altered inherent toxic behavior of SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. In addition, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) phosphorylate was found at different residues, which play an essential role in orchestrating apoptosis and autophagy threshold. Route-dependent corona formation determined GSK3β phosphorylation status and ultimately the toxic behavior of SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. This work presented the evidence of bio-corona on the regulation of SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-induced toxicity, which can be used to guide risk assessment of environmental NPs.",

    "abstract": "Severe malaria (SM) has remained a major global health challenge, disproportionately affecting children in endemic areas. Understanding the factors that influence childhood SM outcomes is critical for developing contextualized early warning scores, effective prevention, and treatment strategies. This is a retrospective, multicenter study conducted between year 2019 and 2022 involving children diagnosed with SM based on World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of in-hospital mortality from significantly associated factors on bivariate analysis. Of the 7765 children admitted to emergency rooms, 997 (12.8%) had SM, with a median age of 4 (IQR: 2.7). M: F ratio of 1.2:1. Anemia (353: 35.4%), hemoglobinuria (348: 34.9%), cerebral malaria (331: 33.1%), and prostration (325: 32.6%) were the most common manifestations of SM. Half (494, 49.5%) of the children had only one form of SM, followed by a combination of three forms (270: 27.1%) of SM. Nine of 43 children with severe acute kidney injury received peritoneal dialysis, while 19 received haemodialysis. Severe shock (75.0%) and a patient with respiratory distress syndrome received mechanical ventilation support. The determinants of increased mortality included the first day of admission [OR (95% CI):24.44 (9.792, 61.007)], and manifestations of shock with a 17-fold [OR (95% CI): 17.682 (4.159, 75.196)] increased mortality. SM still carries a significant risk of increased mortality, the need for dialysis, and mechanical ventilation support. The first 24 h after admission, as well as the shock, are determinants of increased mortality.",

    "abstract": "Employees are the real capital of any organisation, and to keep the employees productive and functional, employers need to focus on the psychological capital and social relationship of the employees to keep them engaged in their work. This study examined the emerging field of constructs of psychological and social capital to examine Indian employee's behaviour. The purpose of this study is to examine a comprehensive model of the relationship between employees' psychological capital and work engagement. Furthermore, it examines the moderating effect of social relationships between them. This is a primary survey conducted mainly on the manufacturing industry. A sample of 375 mid- and senior-level executives of different age groups was considered in the study from India's public and private manufacturing sectors administering a questionnaire survey. A random sampling technique was used for data collection. This study applied SPSS and Amos software to validate the measurement model. The results indicate a significant correlation among PsyCap, work engagement, and social relationships. PsyCap and social relationships are positively connected to work engagement. Thus, these results provide preliminary support for our hypotheses. The finding suggests that psychological capital and social relationships positively influence work engagement, and social relationships moderate the association between positive psychological capital and work engagement. It helps employees get better engaged at work. Organisations must develop psychological capital to provide resources to employees and share a supportive relationship. Developing and maintaining a supportive relationship for employees and employers is important. In the future, both qualitative research methods and longitudinal data from other sectors can be used to understand the interplay between social and psychological capital for enhancing work engagement. Developing and cultivating positive social relations can help employees utilise their psychological strength to better engage in work.",

    "abstract": "Structural mentoring barriers are policies, practices and cultural norms that collectively disadvantage marginalized groups and perpetuate disparities in mentoring. This study aims to better understand structural mentoring barriers at the postdoctoral training stage, which has a direct impact on faculty diversity and national efforts to retain underrepresented groups in research careers. A diverse sample of postdoctoral scholars (\"postdocs\") from across the USA were asked to participate in focus groups to discuss their training experiences. The authors conducted five 90-min focus groups with 32 biomedical postdocs, including 20 (63%) women and 15 (47%) individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups (URG). A social-ecological framework was used to categorize both the upstream and downstream manifestations of structural mentoring barriers, as well as mentoring barriers, overall. Notable structural barriers included: academic politics and scientific hierarchy; inequalities resulting from mentor prestige; the (over) reliance on one mentor; the lack of formal training for academic and non-academic careers; and the lack of institutional diversity and institutional mentor training. To overcome these barriers, postdocs strongly encouraged developing a network or team of mentors and recommended institutional interventions that create more comprehensive professional development, mentorship and belonging. For postdoctoral scientists, structural mentoring barriers can permeate down to institutional, interpersonal and individual levels, impeding a successful transition to an independent research career. This work provides strong evidence for promoting mentorship networks and cultivating a \"mentoring milieu\" that fosters a supportive community and a strong culture of mentorship at all levels.",

    "abstract": "The health and well-being of transgender, non-binary, and gender-diverse people is receiving increasing attention from epidemiologists and public health researchers, including those utilizing longitudinal observational cohort studies. These longitudinal studies are advantageous over cross-sectional observational study designs given their scope over several timepoints rather than one, and when exposures and outcomes are prospectively measured this improves validity of causal claims. However, within these longitudinal studies, gender is often collected inconsistently (e.g. only asked at a single timepoint), or inadequately (e.g. questions that use limiting notions of gender). Due to the temporal nature of gender, this introduces potential including misclassification error and may provide an incomplete picture of gender diversity in a sample. This article considers these methodological issues and offers evidence-based recommendations to ensure longitudinal data on trans, non-binary, and gender-diverse people is treated with epidemiological rigor, while maintaining inclusivity.",

In the case of the Parchemins study, which followed undocumented migrants over their process of regularization and during the first years of regularized life in Geneva, we underscore the difficulties in recruiting and keeping respondents who come from such a hard-to-reach population. Factors hindering their participation include the fear of being denounced as undocumented, missing time due to high workload, health issues, or language problems. Using unique data from the recruitment and the follow-up processes, we demonstrate that investing high resources and time is particularly beneficial to reach such a population and to reduce attrition over successive data collection waves. In addition, we present the strategies adopted to draw a convenient sample from our targeted population, which mainly relies on generating trust.",

Phylogenetic analyses support the placement of <i>Plotornis</i> outside of the clade uniting all extant albatrosses. The new fossil reveals that stem lineage albatrosses were widespread by the onset of the Neogene. Although the humerus of <i>Plotornis archaeonautes</i> exhibits a short processus supracondylaris dorsalis, this early species may have possessed at least one of the unique ossifications associated with the patagial bracing system present in modern albatrosses.",

An early diagnosis based on a high index of suspicion allows for timely surgical management of potentially fatal airway trauma, thereby improving overall outcomes. Diagnosing these injuries can be difficult due to their nonspecific clinical features and the occasional difficulty in radiologic diagnosis. If a patient exhibits respiratory compromise with difficult ventilation and poor lung expansion, despite the insertion and management of an intercostal drain following high-energy blunt trauma, there should be a heightened suspicion of potential airway trauma. The aim of primary repair is to restore airway integrity and to minimize the loss of pulmonary parenchyma function. This case report discusses the rare clinical presentation of a patient with blunt trauma to the intrathoracic airway, the surgical management thereof, and his overall outcome. Although blunt traumatic injuries of the trachea are extremely rare and often fatal, early surgical intervention can potentially reduce the risk of mortality.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to compare the characteristics of patients with trauma by age group in a single center in Korea to identify the clinical characteristics and analyze the risk factors affecting mortality. Patients aged ≥18 years who visited the Chungbuk National University Hospital Regional Trauma Center between January 2016 and December 2022 were included. The accident mechanism, severity of the injury, and outcomes were compared by classifying the patients into group A (18-64 years), group B (65-79 years), and group C (≥80 years). In addition, logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting death. The most common injury mechanism was traffic accidents in group A (40.9%) and slipping in group B (37.0%) and group C (56.2%). Although group A had the highest intensive care unit admission rate (38.0%), group C had the highest mortality rate (9.5%). In the regression analysis, 3 to 8 points on the Glasgow Coma Scale had the highest odds ratio for mortality, and red blood cell transfusion within 24 hours, intensive care unit admission, age, and Injury Severity Score were the predictors of death. For patients with trauma, the mechanism, injured body region, and severity of injury differed among the age groups. The high mortality rate of elderly patients suggests the need for different treatment approaches for trauma patients according to age. Identifying factors affecting clinical patterns and mortality according to age groups can help improve the prognosis of trauma patients in the future.",

    "title": "A Cross-sectional Observational Study to Correlate the Trichoscopic Findings of Female Pattern Hair Loss with the Disease Severity and Underlying Histopathological Changes.",
    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is an alarming concern. Trichoscopy is an important bedside diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of FPHL, but there are very few studies correlating it with disease severity or histopathological findings which would provide a better insight to the treating clinician. Hence, we decided to take up this study. This study aimed to study the trichoscopic findings of FPHL and correlate their relationship with disease severity and histopathological finding in our tertiary care hospital. Ninety females attending the dermatology outpatient department who were clinically diagnosed with FPHL were included in the study after informed consent and clearance from the institutional ethics committee. This was followed by a detailed history, clinical examination, and trichoscopic assessment. A trichoscopy-guided biopsy was performed from two sites. After the data collection, the statistical software used was IBM SPSS version 21.0 and Microsoft Office Excel 2007. <i>P</i> < 0.05 was accepted as indicative of statistical significance. Anisotrichosis, increased interfollicular distance, and decreased hairs per follicular unit were universal. Brown peripilar sign had a positive association with inflammation (<i>P</i> < 0.0005) and white peripilar sign with duration of disease and fibrosis whereas dartboard sign had a significant association with inflammation as well as fibrosis. Trichoscopy helps in diagnosing the condition, assessing the severity, and monitoring the response to treatment. A knowledge about the features underlying specific trichoscopic signs such as inflammation and fibrosis would help the clinician decide the line of management.",

    "title": "Adherence of Physicians to Local Guideline Recommendations among Patients with COVID-19 in Two Tertiary Public Hospitals in Metro Manila, Philippines: A Rapid Assessment Study.",
    "abstract": "Adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPG) has been shown to reduce inter-physician practice variation and improve quality of care. This study evaluated guideline adherence of physicians in two tertiary public hospitals to local CPG on COVID-19. This was a multicenter, retrospective chart review, rapid assessment method study. Guideline adherence and non-adherence (overuse and underuse) to 15 strong recommendations in the prevailing Philippine COVID-19 Living Recommendations were assessed among a sample of patients admitted in two centers from July to October 2021. Differences in adherence across COVID-19 disease severities and managing hospital units were analyzed. A total of 723 patient charts from two centers were reviewed. Guideline adherence to dexamethasone use among patients with hypoxemia is 91.4% (95% CI 88.6 to 93.6) with 9.2% overuse. Tocilizumab was underused in 52.2% of patients with indications to receive the drug. There was overuse of empiric antibiotics in 43.6% of patients without suspicion of bacterial coinfection. Lowest adherence to antibiotic use was seen among patients with critical disease severity and those managed in the intensive care unit. None of the other non-recommended treatment modalities were given. Management of COVID-19 in both centers was generally adherent to guideline recommendations. We detected high underuse of tocilizumab probably related to the global supply shortage during the study period and high overuse of antibiotics in patients without suspicion of bacterial coinfection. While the results of this study cannot be generalized in other healthcare settings, we recommend the application of similar rapid assessment studies in guideline adherence evaluation as a quality improvement tool and to identify issues with resource utilization especially during public health emergencies.",

    "abstract": "Asymptomatic bronchial artery aneurysms (BAA) could be underdiagnosed, and the precise prevalence is unknown. Bronchial artery angiography revealed that this rare disease in about 1% of patients. BAA is fatal if ruptured since there is no correlation between the diameter and symptoms of the aneurysm and the risk of rupture. Early treatment on diagnosis is desirable. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is the first choice for treatment because of its minimally invasive nature. A 74-year-old man was referred to our department and pointed out a tumor-like lesion under the aortic arch on a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). We diagnosed it as a mediastinal BAA, and BAE was planned. The bronchial artery arising from the aorta showed strong atherosclerotic meanders and was difficult to engage, resulting in iatrogenic acute aortic dissection (AAD). Urgent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was performed. There was no contrast effect of the aneurysm on a postoperative CECT, indicating thrombotic occlusion. We were preparing a system that could convert to surgery or TEVAR, in case of difficult to treat with BAE or ruptured aneurysm during BAE, so we were able to respond quickly to aortic dissection caused by BAE and obtain a good result of both BAA and aortic dissection. TEVAR would be considered a treatment of BAA, in cases such as the present case, where engagement is difficult, where the length of the inflow artery is short, or where the inflow artery is tortuous.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the Philippines and about 3 in every 100 Filipina will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. There is a need to discover safe, yet inexpensive herbal extracts with potential cytotoxic properties as potential treatment modalities to treat breast cancer. This study seeks to explore the cytotoxic and apoptotic properties of the ethyl acetate fraction of the defatted crude methanol leaf extract of <i>Syzygium samarangense</i> in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Screening for flavonoids of the extracts was performed using TLC, total flavonoids, total phenols, FTIR and LC-MS spectroscopy. The hydrogen peroxide and ferric reducing anti-oxidant power were used as substrates to assess <i>in vitro</i> anti-oxidative properties of the extracts. The MTT dye viability assay was used to assess the cytotoxic properties of the extracts against MCF-7 cells. Apoptotic properties of the extracts in MCF-7 cells were determined by caspase-3 activation assay, DNA fragmentation patterns and fluorescence microscopy after annexin-V and propidium iodide staining. The abundance of flavonoids in the ethyl acetate fraction of the crude methanol leaf extract was established by TLC, FTIR, LC-MS/MS, total flavonoid and total phenol analyses. The <i>in vitro</i> anti-oxidative properties of this extract was comparable to ascorbic acid. The median inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of this extract in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines was 7.2 mcg/mL while doxorubicin registered an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.2 mcg/mL. At this concentration, the extract was not cytotoxic to normally-dividing breast epithelial cells. Cytotoxicity of the extract was mediated via apoptosis as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation and fluorescence microscopic analyses. The study shows that the flavonoid-rich ethyl acetate fraction of the crude methanol leaf extract of <i>S. samarangense</i> possesses potent apoptotic and cytotoxic properties against MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines at low concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of defects around the knee and the proximal third of the leg necessitates thin, pliable skin with a stable and sensate soft tissue cover. This study analyzed the use of a proximally based sural artery flap for the coverage of such defects. This prospective clinical interventional study involved 10 patients who had soft tissue defects over the knee and the proximal third of the leg. These patients underwent reconstruction with a proximally based sural artery flap. The study analyzed various factors including age, sex, etiology, location and presentation of the defect, defect dimensions, flap particulars, postoperative complications, and follow-up. There were 10 cases, all of which involved men aged 20 to 65 years. The most common cause of injury was trauma resulting from road traffic accidents. The majority of defects were found in the proximal third of the leg, particularly on the anterolateral aspect. Defect dimensions varied from 6×3 to 15×13 cm<sup>2</sup>, and extensive defects as large as 16 cm × 14 cm could be covered using this flap. The size of the flaps ranged from 7×4 to 16×14 cm<sup>2</sup>, and the pedicle length was 10 to 15 cm. In all cases, donor site closure was achieved with split skin grafting. This flap consistently provided a thin, pliable, stable, and durable soft tissue cover over the defect with no functional deficit and minimal donor site morbidity. Complications, including distal flap necrosis and donor site graft loss, were observed in two cases. The proximally based sural fasciocutaneous flap serves as the primary method for reconstructing medium to large soft tissue defects around the knee and the proximal third of the leg. This technique offers thin, reliable, sensate, and stable soft tissue coverage, and can cover larger defects with minimal complications.",

A quantitative descriptive and observational study was conducted in 14 public schools in a municipality in Rio de Janeiro and their surrounding areas. Photographic records and field diaries were adopted for this purpose. Food-related murals, vegetable gardens, school cafeterias, and teachers sitting along during meals were considered components that promote a healthy food environment. Competing components were snacks brought by students, canteens, informal food sale and packaging, and ultra-processed foods circulating in schools. A 500-meter radius from the school gate was considered to characterize outlets in the school surroundings. The foods sold were categorized per the NOVA classification. The study identified a predominance of healthy eating-promoting factors against competing factors. However, we identified available ultra-processed foods inside schools, and their availability prevailed in the school's surrounding areas.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the effects of comorbid diseases and antihypertensive drugs on the clinical outcome of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. A total of 1045 patients whose data could be gathered and confirmed from both hospital files and Turkish National Health Network records were retrospectively screened, and 264 of 1045 patients were excluded because of having more than one comorbid disease. The study population consisted of a total of 781 patients, of which 482 had no comorbid disease, while the remaining 299 patients had only one comorbid disease. The mortality risk was 7.532 times higher in those over 65 years of age compared to cases younger than 30 years (OR: 7.532; 95% CI: 1.733-32.730); the risk of mortality in men was 2.131 times higher than in women (OR: 2.131; 95% CI: 1.230-3.693); and presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) increased mortality risk 2.784 times (OR: 2.784; 95% CI: 1.288-6.019). While hypertension was not found to be an independent risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, age, gender, and presence of DM were independent risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. There was no association between antihypertensive drugs and mortality. Accordingly, age (>65 years), gender (male), and presence of DM were independent risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, whereas hypertension and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and their combinations with other antihypertensive drugs were not risk factors for COVID-19 mortality.",

Study conducted with 46,164 Brazilians, aged 10 or over, evaluated by the Household Budget Survey (Pesquisa de Orçamentos Familiares - POF 2017-2018). Food consumption was assessed through a 24-hour recall, with DTAC determined by calculating the sum of the antioxidant content of the intake of each food, taken from a database containing information on the DTAC value in mmol/100g of 3,100 foods. Multinomial logistic regression models were proposed to test the relationship between socioeconomic factors and DTAC. The median DTAC was 3.48 (0.62-24.55) mmol/1000 Kcal. Women, older individuals (adults and the elderly), and residents of rural areas and the Northeast, South, and Southeast regions of the country showed a higher intake of antioxidants. By contrast, individuals with higher educational and income levels presented lower DTAC values. The socioeconomic and demographic scenario was associated with the consumption of antioxidants, reinforcing the importance of identifying risk groups for inadequate nutrition in order to better guide the implementation of public policies and nutritional interventions.",

Developing a conception of housing density based on 'density expressions' and 'density modalities', we argue for a focus on how domestic density is experienced and intervened in by residents and other groups. This approach builds in existing work in Housing Studies and Urban Studies on domestic overcrowding by demonstrating the value of attending to its sensorial experiences, and practices that seek to alleviate those experiences. Drawing on fieldwork in Hong Kong, one of the densest and more unequal housing markets in the world, we identify 'infiltration' as a key form of density expression. We go on explore two density modalities through which residents and other groups, including civil society organisations and the state, practice modest forms of intervention in the struggles of precarious housing: 'improvisation' and 'transition'. We conclude by considering the implications both on housing in Hong Kong and for future research on precarious housing.",

This cross-sectional study was conducted with 147 children aged 1 to 9 attending at three reference health centers in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Diet quality data was assessed using Healthy Eating Indices. The Brazilian Scale of Food and Nutrition Insecurity measured HFI status. Associations between HFI and dietary practices were assessed using logistic regression models. Almost half of the children lived with food insecurity (47.6%). HFI was associated with deteriorated diet quality, evidenced by the increased weekly frequency of consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF), such as sugar-sweetened beverages and processed meats, and reduced frequency of fruits and vegetables. Parents perceived a reduction in meat and milk consumption and an increase in the intake of UPF among households of children in HFI throughout the pandemic. Our results suggest that HFI status was associated with deterioration in diet quality during the critical phase of social isolation.",

    "abstract": "Current assessment standards for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), such as the ankle brachial index, are limited in their utility and portability. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has shown some promise in diagnosing PAD when used in conjunction with a provocative maneuver. The purpose of this study was to assess the viability of NIRS in conjunction with a transient leg elevation provocative maneuver for detecting severe PAD. This retrospective observational cross-sectional study assessed 57 limbs in 34 patients receiving routine vascular screening for PAD at Madigan Army Medical Center. The patient limbs were stratified into normal (n = 17), mild (n = 9), moderate (n = 16), and severe (n = 15) PAD groups based on the clinician assessments. Additionally, the patients were assessed with NIRS measurements taken with the patient in the supine position at rest and using a provocative leg raise maneuver of transient leg elevation of 45° for 60 seconds. The resting tissue oxygen saturation (StO<sub>2</sub>) and the change in StO<sub>2</sub> (ΔStO<sub>2</sub>) from rest to elevation were recorded and compared between the PAD severity groups via independent measures analysis of variance with the Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test. The supine resting StO<sub>2</sub> was not different between the normal (77.5% ± 7.7%), mild (72.5% ± 7.4%), moderate (72.0% ± 10.3%), and severe (74.2% ± 5.4%) PAD groups (<i>P</i> = .23). However, the ΔStO<sub>2</sub> with transient leg elevation was significantly greater in the severe PAD group (-17.2% ± 6.0%) compared with the normal (-3.9% ± 4.8%), mild (-6.9% ± 4.7%), and moderate (-9.7% ± 5.2%) PAD groups (<i>P</i> < .002 for all). Similar results were observed in the changes in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. The leg elevation protocol was also used for two patients before and after lower limb revascularization, which demonstrated that the ΔStO<sub>2</sub> corresponded with the clinical assessment of PAD severity. Resting supine NIRS images were unable to detect any differences among normal and limbs with different PAD severity. However, NIRS imaging with 45° leg elevation for 60 seconds showed a significant difference between severe PAD compared healthy patients and those with mild to moderate PAD in a fast, precise, and accurate manner. These preliminary data support the use of NIRS and transient leg elevation as a tool to diagnose severe PAD but do not support the use of NIRS alone as a screening test for PAD. NIRS measurements with leg elevation might be a viable noninvasive, noncontact, and portable method of assessing severe PAD for home monitoring, in rural communities, and/or in standard clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The present article serves as a comprehensive review of the published research literature surrounding the retinal microvasculature, characterized through the optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and its potential clinical value for understanding and detecting cerebrovascular diseases. Studies from the past 3 years (2020-2023) have identified a degeneration of the retinal microvasculature, commonly defined through the loss of vascular density, in ischemic stroke, dementia, carotid artery stenosis, cerebral small vessel disease, and a series of rare, potentially inherited cerebrovascular disorders. These retinal microvascular changes often correlate with structure and functional changes in the brain and sometimes occur prior to debilitating neurodegeneration. While further investigations with longitudinal data and larger sample sizes are necessary, OCTA shows promising results for characterizing the retinal microvasculature as a potential imaging biomarker in reflecting the changes in the cerebral microvasculature for early detection, prevention, and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "This article reports on ethnographic research on ongoing changes in FGM/C among the Maasai community of the Loita Hills, southwest Kenya. The study identified the individual, social, material, and institutional factors that sustain FGM/C in Loita. It then examined how these factors changed under the influence interventions by the nongovernmental organisation S.A.F.E., national anti-FGM/C legislation, school-based education, and religion. S.A.F.E.'s song performances weakened the social taboo that prevented people from discussing FGM/C; their alternative rite of passage (ARP) made it possible to abandon FGM/C while continuing other elements of the initiation ceremony; the blessing of the ARP by the cultural leadership made not-cutting culturally acceptable; and the public declaration addressed some concerns around the social consequences of not-cutting. Anti-FGM/C legislation drove the practice underground and reinforced its meanings as an ethnic identity marker. School-based education changed people's socio-economic circumstances, facilitating the abandonment of FGM/C without the need to replace it with an LRP. Protestant Loitai initiated their daughters through a religious initiation rite. Together, these influence contributed to the incremental decline of FGM/C in Loita. However, half of the community seems to continue practising FGM/C, because of its meanings that go beyond initiation into adulthood and/or because of continued concerns around the social consequences of not-cutting. Sustained efforts that dynamically adapt to the ever-changing social realities, including potential resurgences in prevalence, can support the community on its path towards total abandonment.",

    "title": "Assessing the Quality of Recruitment Information on Skull Base Surgical Fellowship Program Websites.",
    "abstract": "<b>Introduction</b>  The American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), North American Skull Base Society (NASBS), American Rhinologic Society (ARS), and American Neurotology Society (ANS) fellowship directories are important information repositories for skull base surgical fellowship programs. However, there is limited research on the amount and depth of information available through these resources. The objective of the present study is to assess Web site accessibility and information availability for individual fellowship programs listed within the AANS, NASBS, ARS, and ANS fellowship directories. <b>Methods</b>  Lists of all accredited skull base surgical programs were obtained from the AANS and NASBS fellowship directories. Duplications in listed programs were removed, and systematic queries via an online search engine were conducted to identify fellowship Web sites. From each available Web site, information pertaining to 24 different variables was collected and organized into two categories-recruitment and education. Differences in the availability of information on recruitment and education were then compared across Web sites and contextualized relative to other surgical specialties. <b>Results</b>  After excluding duplicates, 113 fellowship programs were identified, of which 99 (87.6%) had accessible Web sites. Of the 48 listed by the NASBS, direct Web site links were available for 33 (68.8%), email contacts were accessible for 32 (66.7%), and phone numbers were listed for 6 (12.5%). Of the 39 programs listed by the AANS, none included Web site links, 38 (97.4%) provided an email contact, and 39 (100%) listed a departmental contact telephone number. All 28 (100%) programs listed by the ANS provided a phone and email contact in addition to a Web site link to each institutional Web site. Of the 33 programs listed by the ARS, 29 (88%) had a departmental contact telephone number, 31 (94%) had an email contact available, and 4 (12%) had a program Web site link directly available from the database Web site. Of the 99 total programs, fellowship Web sites displayed an average of 5.46 (42.0%) of the 13 recruitment features and 4.80 (42.6%) of the 11 education features. Programs in the geographic Northeast were significantly less likely to present information pertaining to recruitment ( <i>p</i>  = 0.023). Furthermore, programs in geographic Northeast and West were significantly less likely to present information focused on surgical training and/or education ( <i>p</i>  = 0.006). <b>Conclusion</b>  Although many skull base fellowship programs have maintained comprehensive program Web sites, certain critical aspects remain deficient, and some programs provide little to no information. Providing more detailed information about programs can prove mutually beneficial for fellowship program directors and candidates.",

Occupational therapists are well positioned to address these needs; however, there is little evidence exploring occupational therapy's role in this area. This retrospective study of electronic medical records examined changes in activities of daily living participation for adult patients (<i>n</i> = 37) who received occupational therapy in acute care while recovering from cardiothoracic surgery via median sternotomy. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and paired <i>t</i>-tests compared patients' scores on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care \"6-Clicks\" Daily Activity Inpatient Short Form at occupational therapy evaluation and discharge from their inpatient stay. Patients showed statistically significant improvements on both assessments in activities of daily living participation while receiving occupational therapy services following cardiothoracic surgery. Lower body dressing, toileting, and bed mobility showed the greatest increases in the FIM categories. Occupational therapists are valuable in addressing the complex needs of patients recovering from cardiothoracic surgery in acute care. Continued research is needed to provide further evidence supporting occupational therapy's unique role in this setting.",

    "abstract": "School value-added models are widely applied to study, monitor, and hold schools to account for school differences in student learning. The traditional model is a mixed-effects linear regression of student current achievement on student prior achievement, background characteristics, and a school random intercept effect. The latter is referred to as the school value-added score and measures the mean student covariate-adjusted achievement in each school. In this article, we argue that further insights may be gained by additionally studying the variance in this quantity in each school. These include the ability to identify both individual schools and school types that exhibit unusually high or low variability in student achievement, even after accounting for differences in student intakes. We explore and illustrate how this can be done via fitting mixed-effects location scale versions of the traditional school value-added model. We discuss the implications of our work for research and school accountability systems.",

We aimed to evaluate the association between remote work and weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic in two cities in southern Brazil. A population-based cross-sectional study carried out in the southern region of Brazil. Data were collected face-to-face, in households selected by census sampling. The outcome was weight gain, and the exposure was remote working. To verify this association, Poisson Regression was used to calculate the crude and adjusted prevalence ratio and its 95% confidence intervals, using 5% significance level. In total, 2,152 individuals were interviewed. The prevalence of weight gain during the pandemic was 38.4% (95%CI 36.1-40.7), being significantly higher in those who worked remotely (47.0% vs 37.7, p=0.02). Those individuals who worked remotely were 23% more likely to gain weight during the pandemic compared to those who did not work remotely (PR: 1.23; 95%CI 1.02-1.49). Health and education services may be encouraged to implement educational actions at the collective level, aimed at enlightening the population and preventing weight gain in periods of confinement.",

    "abstract": "To improve the validity of self-report measures, researchers should control for response style (RS) effects, which can be achieved with IRTree models. A traditional IRTree model considers a response as a combination of distinct decision-making processes, where the substantive trait affects the decision on response direction, while decisions about choosing the middle category or extreme categories are largely determined by midpoint RS (MRS) and extreme RS (ERS). One limitation of traditional IRTree models is the assumption that all respondents utilize the same set of RS in their response strategies, whereas it can be assumed that the nature and the strength of RS effects can differ between individuals. To address this limitation, we propose a mixture multidimensional IRTree (MM-IRTree) model that detects heterogeneity in response strategies. The MM-IRTree model comprises four latent classes of respondents, each associated with a different set of RS traits in addition to the substantive trait. More specifically, the class-specific response strategies involve (1) only ERS in the \"ERS only\" class, (2) only MRS in the \"MRS only\" class, (3) both ERS and MRS in the \"2RS\" class, and (4) neither ERS nor MRS in the \"0RS\" class. In a simulation study, we showed that the MM-IRTree model performed well in recovering model parameters and class memberships, whereas the traditional IRTree approach showed poor performance if the population includes a mixture of response strategies. In an application to empirical data, the MM-IRTree model revealed distinct classes with noticeable class sizes, suggesting that respondents indeed utilize different response strategies.",

    "abstract": "In higher education, instructors and administrators use student evaluations of teaching (SETs) as formative and summative assessments of instruction; thus, they need adequate response rates for optimal validity and reliability. Veterinary students are often requested to complete dozens of SETs each semester, and response rate is shown to decline as the number of SETs increases. Allowing students to complete SETs after final examinations has been suggested to help increase response; however, students' knowledge of their final course grade has been previously shown to negatively influence SET scores. This case study explored how making SETs available to veterinary students after final exams affected quantitative item scores and response rate when compared to SETs administered during the final weeks of the semester, prior to final examinations. Participants (<i>n</i> = 262) were randomly assigned to before finals or after finals groups, and 171 students completed 2,926 SETs. Students were more likely to complete evaluations before finals (vs. after), and first-year students completed more SETs than third-year students. Compared to the prior year, in which SETs were administered before finals, students in the study year completed 31% fewer SETs. Timing of SET delivery did not significantly affect SET item scores, but third-year students rated instructors higher than first-year students on five of 10 items. Students' self-reported expected grade was positively correlated with all 10 SET items for both groups. In this study, timing of completion had no statistical effect on SET item score. However, when students completed SETs after final exams, response rates decreased.",

For an enlarged SMT, removal of the SMT may be required in addition to the routine MVD to precisely localize the offending vessels. The objective of this study is to investigate the predictive factors influencing the requirement of SMT removal during trigeminal MVD. <b>Methods</b>  We retrospectively reviewed 197 patients who underwent MVD for TN, and analyzed the correlation of the SMT height and other clinicosurgical data with the necessity to remove the SMT during MVD. The parameters evaluated in the statistical analyses included maximum SMT height, patient's clinical characteristics, surgical data including the type and number of offending vessels, and surgical outcomes. <b>Results</b>  SMT removal was required for 20 patients among a total of enrolled 197 patients. In the univariate analysis, maximum SMT height, patient's age, and number (≥ 2) of offending vessels were associated with the requirement for SMT removal. Multivariate analysis with binary logistic regression revealed that the maximum SMT height and number (≥ 2) of offending vessels were significant factors influencing the necessity for SMT removal. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that an SMT height ≥ 4.8 mm was the optimal cutoff value for predicting the need for SMT removal. <b>Conclusion</b>  Large SMTs and the presence of multiple offending vessels are helpful in predicting the technical difficulty of trigeminal MVD associated with the necessity of SMT removal.",

Gains made from successful treatment in prison are often lost in this transition. The current paper evaluates this process for one justice programme, Chesterfield HARP, a Therapeutic Community based in the Chesterfield County jail that continues supporting former inmates through their release by examining engagement and retention rates and changes in recovery capital among incarcerated individuals before incarceration and after transition to recovery housing in the community. Adult prisoners (both male and female) who engaged in the Chesterfield HARP programme completed an assessment of recovery capital (REC-CAP instrument) while in prison and following their transitions to one of a number of local recovery residences with strong links to the prison programme (ensuring continuity of care and support). The results suggest successful bridging with positive growth across multiple recovery capital domains. The study provides further evidence for the importance of continuity of care and integrated models of strength-building and recovery-focused interventions in successfully bridging the transition from prison to the community for offenders with a SUD history.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate differences between phakic, pseudophakic, and scarred stromal donor tissue for their influence on complication rates during preparation or implantation and on the postoperative outcome of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK). We retrospectively compared 484 eyes undergoing DMEK, divided into 3 subgroups of donor tissue (1: phakic, 2: pseudophakic, and 3: scarred stromal). Visual acuity, central corneal thickness (CCT), and endothelial cell count were monitored preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications was analyzed. The risk of adherence and tearing during preparation was significantly higher in group 2 than in the other groups (p's < 0.001). No significant difference was found for visual acuity (p's ≥ 0.368) and long-term CCT, but CCT recovery took longer in group 2 (P = 0.003), normalizing after 3 months (p's ≥ 0.096). The overall mean endothelial cell count was lower in group 2 compared with the other groups (P = 0.011). No difference in the rebubbling rate was detected (P = 0.890). However, the risk of repeat keratoplasty for phakic grafts was lower compared with group 2 (P = 0.008). Pseudophakic donor grafts are more difficult to prepare and implant, resulting in longer recovery times and a higher risk of graft failure. However, when the preparation is uneventful and no graft failure occurs, pseudophakic grafts show a comparable outcome. Given the shortage of corneal donors and the high prevalence of pseudophakic corneal donors, they should not generally be excluded from corneal donation for DMEK.",

    "abstract": "When compared to conventional forceps biopsy, the use of a flexible cryoprobe allows for the sampling of endobronchial lesions, yielding well-preserved, circumferential, and substantial specimens, resulting in a higher diagnostic yield, as demonstrated in multiple studies. We evaluated the utility of cryobiopsy in the diagnosis of endobronchial lesions, as well as its safety profile in this study. This retrospective study included 200 patients who underwent cryobiopsy for bronchoscopically visible endobronchial lesions between March 2016 and July 2022. Cryobiopsy was performed under conscious sedation using a flexible cryoprobe. Data on baseline patient characteristics, post-biopsy bleeding, and final histopathological diagnosis were collected. We evaluated the procedure's diagnostic yield and safety. The majority of the patients were male (84.5%), and the mean age of the patients was 56.96±13.64 years. In our study, the average size of the cryobiopsy specimen was 6.8±1.2 mm. In 93% of cases, a definitive diagnosis was established; the most common diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (42.5%), followed by adenocarcinoma (18.5%) and small cell carcinoma (13.5%). Tuberculosis and sarcoidosis were reported in 2.5% and 1% of cases, respectively. In this study, 1% of patients had severe bleeding that required intubation and intensive care unit admission, while 26% had moderate bleeding that was treated with cold saline and local epinephrine instillation. No mortality was reported in the study. Endobronchial cryobiopsy with a flexible bronchoscope is a safe procedure with a high diagnostic yield. This approach, which has a favorable safety profile, holds the promise of improving diagnostic and treatment outcomes in lung cancer and other benign lung diseases.",

Basic hypoplastic models introduce the history of loading in state variables such as the stress and void ratio and are therefore incapable of describing small-strain stiffness and cyclic loading. In this work, clay hypoplasticity is extended with a modified intergranular strain proposed by Duque et al. [3]. The new model is compared to the one coupled previously with ISA based on unconventional as well as complex cyclic loading paths. Abilities and limitations of the models are addressed: (i) showing that both models predict a reduction in strain accumulation with an increasing number of cycles. (ii) For both models pronounced over- and undershooting effects can occur for certain cyclic loading paths and certain parameters. Despite the consensus in the literature, the results show that a yield surface in the (intergranular) strain space is not sufficient to ban these effects. Furthermore, the models' predictive capabilities are verified with simulations of monotonic and cyclic tests of Lower Rhine clay.",

Researchers incorporated a number of mixed, overlapping methodologies consisting of both qualitative and quantitative survey responses and focus group interactions. The use of these multiple data representations allowed researchers to gather layered and complex data to provide for a fuller understanding of the initial implementation of the GOLD-E tool.

    "abstract": "Noise in the immunohematological investigations can be described as a false reactivity of red blood cells (RBCs) in serologic testing that is not related to the interaction of RBC antigens and antibodies that the test system is intended to detect. These false-positive reactions can cause confusion during the cross-matching and RBC antibody screening and may result in delays in patient transfusion. Although these antibodies are predominantly clinically insignificant, proper laboratory work-up is indicated to avoid misidentification of a clinically significant antibody as a noise. In this report, we describe the three rare cases where the reactivity was found against the ingredients of the column matrix (glass beads). It is imperative that such reactivity is recognized and resolved during the investigation of blood group discrepancies, positive RBC antibody screens and in cases of positive cross-matches.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the relationship between cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) level and prognosis among mechanically ventilated patients in terms of mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and tracheostomy rate. This is a prospective cohort study conducted at Quirino Memorial Medical Center, a tertiary government hospital, over a period of ten (10) months. Seventy-six (76) mechanically ventilated adult patients admitted at the medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, medical wards, and centers for neurologic sciences were included in the study. Quantitative cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) marker was measured and correlated to prognostic outcomes: a) prolonged ventilation (requiring more than 21 days), b) tracheostomy rate, and c) mortality rate. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 and logistics regression with 95% confidence interval. Results showed that among 76 patients, 15 patients have low cTnI levels, 11 patients have normal levels and 50 patients have elevated levels. Among patients with low cTnI levels (<0.020 ng/mL), 13 (86.7%) were extubated, 1 (6.7%) preceded tracheostomy and 1 (6.7%) expired. Those with normal range cTnI levels (0.020 - 0.060 ng/ mL), 10 (90.9%) were extubated, none (0%) preceded tracheostomy and 1 (9.1%) expired. Those with elevated cTnI levels (>0.060 ng/mL), 7 (14.0%) were extubated, 7 (14.0%) preceded tracheostomy and 36 (72.0%) expired. Analysis of the results showed a significant correlation of cTnI elevation with prognostic outcome proven by the p-value of < 0.0001. The risk of mortality among subjects with above normal cTnI levels were nine times (9x) higher compared to subjects with normal or low cTnI levels. Duration of intubation among patients with low normal and high cTnI levels did not differ significantly. Tracheostomy rate in the study was inconclusive.",

    "title": "Traumatic degloving injuries: a prospective study to assess injury patterns, management, and outcomes at a single center in northern India.",
    "abstract": "This study investigated the epidemiology, management, outcomes, and postoperative disabilities of degloving soft tissue injuries (DSTIs) treated at a tertiary care center in northern India. A prospective study of patients with DSTIs was conducted over 15 months. The type of degloving injury, the mechanism of injury, and any associated injuries were analyzed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 along with the management, outcomes, and disabilities at a 3-month follow-up. Among 75 patients with DSTIs, the average age was 27.5 years, 80.0% were male, and 76.0% had been injured in traffic accidents. The majority (93.3%) were open degloving injuries. Lower limbs were affected most often (62.7%), followed by upper limbs (32.0%). Fractures were the most commonly associated injuries (72.0%). Most patients required more than two procedures, including secondary debridement (41.3%), split skin grafting (80.0%), flap coverage (12.0%), or vacuum-assisted closure (24.0%), while five patients underwent conservative management for closed degloving injuries. Postoperative complications included surgical site infections (14.7%) and skin necrosis (10.7%). Two patients died due to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The mean length of hospital stay was 11.5±8.1 days, with injuries affecting the lower limbs and perineum requiring longer hospital stays. The mean WHODAS 2.0 disability score at 3 months was 19. Most patients had mild disabilities. Time away from work depended largely upon the site and severity of the injury. Approximately 75% of patients resumed their previous job or study, 14% changed their job, and 8% stopped working completely due to residual disability. DSTIs are common injuries in trauma and management is challenging. Although open DSTI are clinically evident at secondary survey, closed degloving injuries may be missed in the primary survey, necessitating a high index of suspicion, thorough clinical examination, and protocol-based management. Primary preventive strategies (e.g., road safety protocols, preplacement training, and proper protective equipment in industries) are also needed to reduce the incidence of these injuries.",

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) has a wide spectrum of potential therapeutic use and is growing in popularity. However, there is a need to characterize users, as associated benefits and risks may differ depending on the pattern of use. This study explored the characteristics of French and Italian CBD users according to their primary reason to use it. We analyzed data from an online survey of French (<i>n</i> = 1164) and Italian (<i>n</i> = 2608) cannabidiol users. We compared their characteristics according to their primary reason to use CBD, and identified correlates of therapeutic use with logistic regressions. In both countries, users' characteristics differed according to their reasons to use CBD. Reporting therapeutic use was associated with daily CBD use and nonsmoking routes of administration in both countries. User profiles differed according to their primary reason to use it. However, similarities in characteristics were found between both countries for users who used CBD for therapeutic reasons. Accordingly, analyzing the reasons to use CBD would appear to be a pertinent way to characterize users and identify their unmet needs in terms of self-care.",

    "abstract": "Documents that subsidize health care for transexual individuals emerged in Brazil in the late twentieth century. As a public policy, the transsexualizer process was redefined in 2013 at the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Literature widely discusses the form as to how the biomedical model crosses healthcare practices and disregards the community's sociocultural aspects. However, in addition to the biological interface, it is known that care practices for trans figures also have identities pervaded by gender binarism. Thus, the present article aimed to carry out a theoretical-conceptual discussion on the fashion that gender binarism influences health-care practices for trans people and violate the diverse possibility of existence of these bodies and identities. Gender binarism is displayed on practices of assistance with the goal of correcting these individuals' bodies into the biological norm: man or woman, ignoring these people's perception and desire over their own bodies, and assigning them a supporting role throughout this process on which they should be a main character. Safe spaces for assistance must be secured which respect these individuals' own desire over their figures and the diverse possibility of human corporeality existence and gender identity.",

We also present the results of a formal systematic review of these injuries which confirmed this is the first such injury described, although there is a very similar fracture pattern described in the literature with dorsal dislocation. We describe the mechanism of injury and hypothesize about the etiology of the fracture pattern and suggest that it represents the end of a spectrum that also includes the isolated dislocations and those associated with an ulna styloid fracture.",

    "abstract": "Inferior vena cava (IVC) injuries, while accounting for fewer than 0.5% of blunt abdominal trauma cases, are among the most difficult to manage. Despite advancements in prehospital care, transportation, operative techniques, and perioperative management, the mortality rate for IVC injuries has remained at 20% to 66% for several decades. Furthermore, 30% to 50% of patients with IVC injuries succumb during the prehospital phase. A 65-year-old male patient, who had been struck in the back by a 500-kg excavator shovel at a construction site, was transported to a regional trauma center. Injuries to the right side of the infrarenal IVC and the right external iliac vein (EIV) were suspected, along with fractures to the right iliac bone and sacrum. The injury to the right side of the infrarenal IVC wall was repaired, and the right internal iliac artery was ligated. However, persistent bleeding around the right EIV was observed, and we were unable to achieve proximal and distal control of the right EIV. Attempts at prolonged manual compression were unsuccessful. To decrease venous return, we ligated the right superficial femoral vein. This reduced the amount of bleeding, enabling us to secure the surgical field. We ultimately controlled the bleeding, and approximately 5 L of blood products were infused intraoperatively. A second-look operation was performed 2 days later, by which time most of the bleeding sites had ceased. Orthopedic surgeons then took over the operation, performing closed reduction and external fixation. Five days later, the patient underwent definitive fixation and was transferred for rehabilitation on postoperative day 22.",

Twelve patients (9%) represented reoperations after failed primary repairs. Fourteen percent of patients undergoing primary surgical repair of STE were diagnosed with IIH, compared with 42% of patients undergoing reoperations ( <i>p</i>  = 0.015). In addition, there was a significant difference in the average BMI of patients undergoing primary (36.4 kg/m <sup>2</sup> ) versus revision surgery (40.9 kg/m <sup>2</sup> , <i>p</i>  = 0.04). Half of those undergoing reoperation were placed on postoperative acetazolamide compared with 11% of patients undergoing primary operations. No patient experienced recurrent leak after reoperation. <b>Conclusion</b>  Based on our institutional experience, elevated BMI and the presence of IIH are significant predictors of reoperation for STE. In our experience, acetazolamide is a common adjunct management strategy in addition to reoperation for patients with recurrent cerebrospinal fluid leak in the setting of STE.",

Post hoc analysis of an open-label extension trial in patients (≥12 years) with SCs (ARTEMIS-2/P261-402: NCT01529034, 2011-004109-25). Caregivers administered MDZ-NS 5 mg when patients experienced an SC; a second 5-mg dose could be given if seizures did not terminate within 10 min or recurred within 10 min-6 h. time to RTFBF within 24 h of MDZ-NS administration in SCEs treated with one or two doses, overall (all treated SCEs), and by number of treated SCEs for each patient over the course of the trial (Kaplan-Meier analyses). Time to RTFBF was assessed from the time of MDZ-NS administration in SCEs treated with one dose, and from the time of the second dose in SCEs treated with two doses. One thousand nine hundred ninety-six treated SCEs (one dose: 1,201 [60.2%]; two doses: 795 [39.8%]) in 161 patients were evaluable. In SCEs treated with one or two doses, RTFBF within 24 h of MDZ-NS administration was observed in 97.2% and 94.2% of patients; the estimated median time was 1.2 and 1.3 h and stable from 1 to 45 treated SCEs. The RTFBF profile was generally similar in SCEs treated with one or two doses (30% of patients estimated to have RTFBF within 30 min, almost 50% within 1 h); the proportion of patients with RTFBF between 2 and 6h was slightly higher with one versus two doses. In almost all patients, RTFBF was observed within 24 h of MDZ-NS administration. The median time to RTFBF was similar in SCEs treated with one or two doses, and stable over the course of repeated intermittent use. Thus, dose (5 or 10 mg) does not seem to be a key influencer of time for RTFBF after repeated intermittent use.",

    "abstract": "Hunger and malnutrition remain serious issues in developing countries, particularly in rural regions. Increased market participation of smallholder farmers can result in improved livelihood and nutrition outcomes. However, smallholder farmers encounter several obstacles that hinder their ability to participate in the market. As a result, the objective of this study is to investigate the factors that influence market participation and its impact on household nutrition security. The study relied on secondary data gathered from a sample size of 1,520 people. About 389 of smallholder farmers participated in the market. The results from Food Consumption Score (FSC) cut-off points showed that in the overall sample households, 54% were within the acceptable food consumption diets (>35), while 30 and 16% were in the borderline (21.5-35) and poor diets (0-21), respectively. According to the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) findings, 57% of smallholder farmers in the total population sample consumed highly diverse diets (consisting of at least six food groups), while 25 and 18% of smallholder farmers consumed diets with medium dietary diversity (consisting of 4-5 food groups) and low dietary diversity (consisting of at most three food groups), respectively. The results from marginal analysis showed that gender of household head, receiving social grants and higher wealth index had a positive impact on market participation. The results from Poisson endogenous treatment effect model showed that household size, ownership of livestock, social grant, wealth index, access to market information, and involvement in crop production had a positive and statistically significant impact on household nutrition security. On the other hand, agricultural assistance showed a negative and significant impact on household nutrition security. It can be concluded that an improvement in agricultural assistance can improve the household nutrition security status. The improvement of agricultural assistance is more associated with improvement of extension services, which can lead to more production of diverse crops and more market participation. Health extension workers need to do more nutrition programs and workshops in rural areas. These programs and workshops will be intended on providing nutrition education, which will create awareness to smallholder farmers on diverse and balanced food items they should produce, sell, and consume.",

    "abstract": "Systematically organizing participation effects may guide participation-based research designs in rehabilitation. This perspective paper uses existing evidence on Pathways and Resources for Engagement and Participation (PREP) to showcase the multitude of effects from a single intervention and synthesize the magnitude of these effects. An outcome matrix of participation effects comprising three dimensions (intermediate, instrumental, ultimate) and two levels (transient, enduring) was used to systematically map PREP's effects. Forest plot demonstrated clinically important changes in the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) across studies. Effect sizes were calculated. The majority of outcomes from 11 studies were mapped to ultimate-transient effects (e.g., changes in participation of self-chosen activities), followed by instrumental-transient effects (e.g., changes in motor body functions). Fewer outcomes were mapped to ultimate-enduring effects (e.g., changes of participation for a longer period or across settings) or intermediate-enduring effects (e.g., therapist-applied knowledge), demonstrating the gaps for investigating enduring effects. COPM changes in most studies (89%) showed clinical significance with small to large effects. Systematic mapping from PREP example guides categorizing multidimensional outcomes. Future participation-based studies can employ individual-based mixed-methods designs to delve into the long-lasting enduring outcomes of youth capacity-building and the transformative process of pursuing meaningful participation goals.",

    "abstract": "The scope of this study was to assess the ototoxic effects and general health of farmers exposed to pesticides in the Pontal do Paranapanema region, SP, Brazil. Participants of both sexes aged 18-40, 40-60 and >60 years were allocated into two groups: Non-Exposed Group (NEG) and Occupationally Exposed Group (OEG). A questionnaire of exposure and health, meatoscopy, pure tone audiometry, logoaudiometry and immittanciometry were assessed. Cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos and glyphosate were the most reported pesticides. The most frequently reported exposure times were 0-10, 31-40 and 51-60 years. Headaches, visual and spinal disorders were the most common complaints, as well as hypertension and gastric and renal disorders. Only 35% (18-40) and 30% (40-60) of the OEG had good hearing perception. Rotational dizziness, ear infection, tinnitus and otalgia were reported. There was an increase in conventional and high frequency hearing thresholds in EWGs, at almost all frequencies and ages, as well as an alteration in the stapedial reflex. It was concluded that occupational exposure to pesticides has ototoxic potential and can harm general health.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objectives</b>  Our objective was to determine if decreased contrast enhancement on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is associated with an increased risk of complication in patients who have undergone nasoseptal flap (NSF) reconstruction. <b>Design/Setting</b>  This was a single-institution retrospective study of patients who underwent a first-time endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) with NSF reconstruction. <b>Participants</b>  Patients underwent an EEA to the skull base with NSF reconstruction and received postoperative MRI within 3 weeks of the operation. <b>Main Outcome Measures</b>  MR exams were scored on the degree of contrast enhancement at first postoperative MRI. An enhancement score of 4 indicated ≥75% enhancement of the NSF. A score of 3 indicated enhancement ≥50% and <75% enhancement of the NSF. A score of 2 indicated ≥25% and <50% enhancement of the NSF. Complications (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] leak, meningitis, empyema, cerebritis, brain abscess, flap necrosis, and flap migration) were retrieved from our institution's skull base database. Logistic regression was used to determine the effect of the MRI enhancement score on the odds of developing a complication. <b>Results</b>  Out of 99 patients in the study, six had complications. Patients who underwent NSF reconstruction of skull base defects were found to have 19 times higher odds of complication ( <i>p</i>  = 0.007) if they had had an NSF enhancement score of 2 on their postoperative MRI when compared with patients with complete or near complete NSF enhancement (score 4). <b>Conclusion</b>  Quantifying NSF enhancement with an MRI may help surgeons better predict which of their patients are at an increased risk of complication.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations constitute a significant proportion of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). It has been suggested that measurement of jugular venous diameter and compliance may have prognostic value in patients with heart failure. We hypothesized that these measurements may also be valuable in patients with advanced COPD. This study was a single-center, prospective, and cross-sectional study conducted in a university hospital between November 2020 and November 2021. In the study, internal jugular vein (IJV) diameters (inspiration, forced expiration, and rest) and jugular venous compliance were measured with ultrasound in patients who presented to the ED with COPD exacerbation. One month later, data about mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and any hospitalization were obtained and evaluated together with a range of laboratory parameters. Data from a total of 93 patients were analyzed. Of these, 17 (18.2%) died, 19 (20.4%) were admitted to the ICU, and 36 (38.7%) were hospitalized at the end of the 1-month period. Consequently, a total of 44 patients (47.3%) were in the good outcome group and 49 patients (52.7%) were in the poor outcome group. In terms of mortality, inspiratory IJV diameter was 5.6 ± 2.9 mm in the survived group (<i>n</i> = 76) and 7.6 ± 3.9 mm in the deceased group (<i>n</i> = 17) (<i>P</i> = 0.031). There was no difference between the venous compliance values and other diameter measurements of the patients. In the analysis performed with the subgroup with high N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide values, it was shown that both resting and inspiration diameter measurements were higher in the group with poor outcomes. There was no difference between the jugular vein compliance values in terms of mortality in patients admitted to the ED with COPD exacerbation. However, these measurements may have prognostic value in patients with COPD exacerbations complicated by heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Spin texture in <b>k</b>-space is a consequence of spin splitting due to strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking. It underlies fertile spin transport phenomena and is of crucial importance for spintronics. Here, we observe the spin texture in <b>k</b>-space of nominally centrosymmetric SrIrO<sub>3</sub> grown on NdGaO<sub>3</sub> (110) substrates, using non-linear magnetotransport measurements. We demonstrate that the spin texture is not only induced by the interface, which inherently breaks the inversion symmetry in strong spin-orbit coupled SrIrO<sub>3</sub> films, but also originates from the film bulk. Structural analysis reveals that thicker SrIrO<sub>3</sub> films exhibit a strain gradient, which could be considered as a continuous change in the lattice constant across different layers and breaks the inversion symmetry throughout the entire SrIrO<sub>3</sub> films, giving rise to the spin texture in <b>k</b>-space. First-principles calculations reveal that the strain gradient creates large spin-splitting bands, inducing the spin texture with anisotropy, which is consistent with our experimental observations. Our results offer an efficient method for inducing the spin textures in <b>k</b>-space.",

National Organisation for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Australia (NOFASD), in conjunction with the University of Otago, New Zealand, piloted and established a 7-week online program to assist caregivers to develop strategies and supports to help their families live well in a disabling society. The online program, Families Linking with Families (FLWF), was delivered to 88 caregivers. They participated in the weekly 90-minute online program of talks, activities, and interactive conversations. A brief evaluation was undertaken. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the content and helpfulness of FLWF. FLWF helped caregivers increase their knowledge of, and skills in, parenting children with FASD, and equipped caregivers to nurture positive peer-to-peer relationships. Specialist FASD caregiver education and support programs are beneficial for caregivers who care for children and youth with FASD. Further research through a randomised control trial could establish the efficacy of the program.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate visual parameters for early detection of ethambutol toxicity to prevent irreversible optic nerve damage. This cohort study included 50 newly diagnosed cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, i.e. 100 eyes, in people aged 18-72 years, who received ethambutol as part of the antitubercular therapy. Before starting antitubercular treatment, at each monthly visit, ophthalmic examination was done that included best corrected visual acuity, optic disc evaluation, colour vision, contrast sensitivity, pupil cycle time and automated perimetry for a period of six months. Ethambutol was discontinued in patients who showed signs of visual impairment. These patients were observed for another three months for reversibility of toxicity. Visual functions were normal in all patients at baseline. Out of 50 patients, 47 didn't show any signs of deterioration in visual functions even after six months of oral administration of ethambutol. However, 3 out of 50 patients, i.e. 6 eyes (6 %), showed signs of toxicity after 4-5 months - LogMAR visual acuity deteriorated from 0.00 to 1.08 (±0.40); mean contrast sensitivity deteriorated from 1.725 (±0.075) to 1.12 (±0.18); mean deviation in visual fields got impaired from -1.37 (±0.15) to -10.93 (±2.66); and colour vision got severely affected. All the affected patients were aged above 65. In the present study, six percent of 50 patients showed ethambutol toxic optic neuropathy. It was concluded that patients should be comprehensively evaluated for visual parameters before starting the ethambutol treatment. They should be closely monitored by an ophthalmologist for visual functions every month to detect ethambutol toxicity at the early reversible stage to prevent irreversible damage to the optic nerve. Patients should be asked to report immediately if they detect any blurring of vision or colour vision abnormality.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report clinical outcomes in patients who underwent revision surgery for glenoid baseplate failure after index reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). A retrospective review was performed to identify patients from 2010 to 2020 at a single institution who sustained glenoid baseplate failure after RSA and underwent revision surgery. Exclusion criteria included periprosthetic joint infection or lack of minimum 1 year clinical and radiographic follow-up. Included patients were contacted for clinical outcomes (American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) and Patient Satisfaction scores). A total of 24 patients were identified, and 22 out of 24 (92%) patients were available for clinical follow-up at a mean period of 3.4 years after final revision surgery. The mean age was 70 years, and 15 out of 22 (68%) patients were female. A total of 17 patients were revised to RSA, and five patients were revised to hemiarthroplasty. For the 22 included patients, the mean follow-up ASES score was 64.6, VAS pain was 2.4 and SANE was 58%, which were all significantly improved versus pre-revision. In total, 64% of patients were satisfied or completely satisfied. Revision surgery after glenoid baseplate failure in RSA yields unpredictable clinical outcomes. Revision to RSA or hemiarthroplasty both resulted in modest functional results with persistent mild pain.",

    "abstract": "Since the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported from Wuhan, China, there has been a surge in scientific research to find a permanent cure for the disease. The main challenge in effective drug discovery is the continuously mutating nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thus, we have used the I-TASSER modeling to predict the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope protein followed by combinatorial computational assessment to predict its putative potential small molecule inhibitors. As early treatment with ritonavir in combination was associated with faster time to clinical improvement and/or virological clearance, we aimed to retrieve analogs of ritonavir to find ideal inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope protein. The collected ligands were screened against the predicted binding pocket of viral envelope protein using extra precision (XP) docking protocol and the first four best-docked compounds were studied for complex stability using 300 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations embedding within the cellular membrane. Among the selected compounds, ZINC64859171 and ZINC1221429 showed considerable stability and interactions by comparison to the reference compound, i.e., Ritonavir (ZINC3944422). Moreover, the post-simulation analysis suggested the considerable binding affinity and induced conformation changes in the respective docked complexes against Ritonavir. Altogether, the obtained results demonstrated the putative potential of screened ritonavir analogs, i.e., ZINC64859171, against the envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 and can be considered for further drug development in the treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

    "abstract": "Individual differences in self-control predict many health and life outcomes. Building on twin literature, we used genomic structural equation modeling to test the hypothesis that genetic influences on executive function and impulsivity predict independent variance in mental health and other outcomes. The impulsivity factor (comprising urgency, lack of premeditation, and other facets) was only modestly genetically correlated with low executive function (<i>r<sub>g</sub></i> =.13). Controlling for impulsivity, low executive function was genetically associated with increased internalizing (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> =.15), externalizing (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> =.13), thought disorders (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> =.38), compulsive disorders (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> =.22), and chronotype (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> =.11). Controlling for executive function, impulsivity was positively genetically associated with internalizing (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> =.36), externalizing (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> =.55), body mass index (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> =.26), and insomnia (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> =.35), and negatively genetically associated with compulsive disorders (<i>β<sub>g</sub></i> = -.17). Executive function and impulsivity were both genetically correlated with general cognitive ability and educational attainment. This work suggests that executive function and impulsivity are genetically separable and show independent associations with mental health.",

    "abstract": "Adverse childhood experiences, such as abuse and neglect, have been shown to have longstanding negative consequences on a child's development and outcomes. Studies have noted that there is variation in how youth in child welfare respond to adversity, yet few studies have examined the psychometrics of measures of resilience in this population. In particular, the 14-item Resilience Scale (RS-14) is a widely used instrument yet has not been evaluated for use with adolescents in child welfare populations. The purpose of the study was to describe the levels of resilience reported by adolescent girls involved in the child welfare system and to evaluate the reliability, validity, and factor structure of this scale in this population. Participants were 249 adolescent girls, ages 12-19, who were involved in the child welfare system. Interviews assessed resilience, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression, social problem-solving, and demographic variables. Results indicated that levels of resilience among the participants were in the moderate range. The RS-14 demonstrated evidence of good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Convergent and discriminant validity were established. Confirmatory factor analysis testing a single-factor solution resulted in a weak model fit. A follow-up exploratory factor analysis supported a two-factor solution. Findings suggest this instrument is an appropriate tool for use in child welfare populations.",

    "abstract": "Scientific evidence sustains PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles' inhalation may generate harmful impacts on human beings' health; therefore, their monitoring in ambient air is of paramount relevance in terms of public health. Due to the limited number of fixed stations within the air quality monitoring networks, development of methodological frameworks to model ambient air PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles is primordial to providing additional information on PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and its trends. In this sense, this work aims to offer a global easily-applicable tool to estimate ambient air PM<sub>2.5</sub> as a function of meteorological conditions using a multivariate analysis. Daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> data measured by 84 fixed monitoring stations and meteorological data from ERA5 (ECMWF Reanalysis v5) reanalysis daily based data between 2000 and 2021 across the United Kingdom were attended to develop the suggested approach. Data from January 2017 to December 2020 were employed to build a mathematical expression that related the dependent variable (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) to predictor ones (sea-level pressure, planetary boundary layer height, temperature, precipitation, wind direction and speed), while 2021 data tested the model. Evaluation indicators evidenced a good performance of model (maximum values of RMSE, MAE and MAPE: 1.80 µg/m<sup>3</sup>, 3.24 µg/m<sup>3</sup>, and 20.63%, respectively), compiling the current legislation's requirements for modelling ambient air PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations. A retrospective analysis of meteorological features allowed estimating ambient air PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations from 2000 to 2021. The highest PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations relapsed in the Mid- and Southlands, while Northlands sustained the lowest concentrations.",

    "abstract": "It is of fundamental importance that the Basic Health Units (BHU) are distributed equally in relation to educational institutions to increase the possibility of greater effectiveness of the actions of the School Health Program (SHP). The objective of the study was to outline a spatial overview of the implementation of the program in Sergipe, observing whether the principle of equitable distribution of actions was being adhered to. It involved a cross-sectional study in which the municipalities that joined the SHP were surveyed and mapping of BHU and public schools was elaborated, observing the occurrence of equity in their distribution via geolocation; and the mean and median distances between health and education equipment were estimated. The results revealed that 1,436 (84.52%) of public schools were participants in the SHP. The mapping and estimation of distance indicated evidence of inequity of actions in schools located in rural areas and peripheral areas of urban regions. In addition, flaws were detected in the geolocation information of the BHUs throughout the state, which can contribute to non-resolutive decision-making, due to the unrealistic view of the distribution of the BHU.",

    "abstract": "Tubercular affection of talus in children is considered extremely rare with literature limited to few case reports. This study reports five cases of tubercular infection of talus in children and traces the various presentations and the treatment outcome. MethodsThe series describes five children with biopsy proven affection of tuberculosis of talus. Data reviewed included the demographic data, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome at final follow up. Among the five cases described in this series, the majority were osseous (4/5). The location of the osseous lesions was noted in the head as well as the head-neck junction of the talus. The duration of symptoms varied from three to 12 months. Three of the five cases healed uneventfully after the initiation of standard anti-tubercular therapy with normal appearing radiographs at the latest follow up. Two cases still had small, geographic lytic lesions in the talus. These might represent healed cystic cavities filled with fibrous. The diagnosis of tuberculosis of talus in children is challenging. A high index of suspicion is required for patients presenting pain around the ankle and hindfoot for more than four weeks. The involvement of the talar bone in tuberculosis can be osseous or synovial. Lesions in the head and neck should particularly be investigated for tubercular etiology. Once diagnosed, antitubercular drugs are effective in healing the lesions clinically as well as radiologically. The presence of lesions in the non-weight bearing area of the talus prevents bony collapse and eventual shape is maintained.",

Industry payments may impact how physician authors view medical devices in the literature. Under-reporting financial conflicts of interest has raised concerns about full transparency between industry and physicians. <b>Objectives:</b> We aim to determine the impact industry payments to physicians have on the cryolipolysis literature and whether there is under-reporting of financial conflicts of interest in the literature. <b>Methods:</b> We collated all articles that cite the pivotal trial in the Food and Drug Administration approval of a cryolipolysis device. Articles were read independently and coded as favourable or neutral. A separate researcher screened the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments database for direct or in-kind payments and recorded financial conflicts of interest. <b>Results:</b> A total of 19 articles met the inclusion criteria. This included 37 unique authors across multiple specialties. Eighteen (95%) published articles had at least one author who received industry payment. Payments totalled $1,476,564.16. Twelve (63%) articles were positive, and 7 (37%) neutral. Of the 31 authors who received payments, 11 (35%) did not report a conflict of interest. The majority of industry payments assessed were for consulting fees, which totalled $980,334.86 (66.4%). <b>Conclusions:</b> We found the majority of published opinions on cryolipolysis from the United States were written by physicians who received industry payments. We also found financial conflicts of interest around cryolipolysis devices are under-reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Peter Townsend (1928-2009) was one of the most important British social scientists of the twentieth century, best known for pioneering and innovative research on poverty, as well as his political campaigning, most notably for the Child Poverty Action Group. This article returns to Townsend's influential work on ageing, for which he first became widely known, during the 1950s and early 1960s. It does so to recover the ways in which his research, first in Bethnal Green at the Institute of Community Studies (ICS), and then at the London School of Economics, as well as the professional and political networks he built during this period, were rooted in and shaped by his home life in Hampstead. As will be shown, the most important figure in the interconnecting spheres of Townsend's career was his wife, Ruth (1927-2011), who not only was central to the construction of a way of life in which the boundaries between research, the domestic sphere, and politics were often so blurred as to be non-existent, but also made significant and underappreciated contributions to her husband's research.",

    "abstract": "The need of the hour is to incorporate a rapid assay that could efficiently detect neonatal sepsis. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of 16SrRNA broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in neonatal sepsis. The demographic and clinical details of 100 neonates clinically suspected to have sepsis were collected adopting pretested clinical proforma, followed by baseline laboratory investigations, including blood culture, complete blood counts, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Around, 0.2-0.3 ml of the EDTA blood was subjected to enrichment followed by DNA isolation using the modified spin column method. Based on the blood culture report, neonates were further divided into the suspected sepsis group (n = 50) and the confirmed sepsis group (n = 50). We performed 16SrRNA broad-range PCR to identify the presence of bacteria, and the results were analyzed statistically using SPSS software. Neonates in both groups were found to have clinical parameters comparable to each other except for birth weight, length, and head circumference, which was found to be lower in the culture-positive group than in culture-negative group (p < 0.05). The diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA broad-range PCR compared to blood culture revealed 100% sensitivity, 64% specificity, and 73.5% positive and 100% negative predictive value. The 18 cases detected positive by PCR had clinical and other diagnostic findings consistent with sepsis. The 16SrRNA broad-range PCR effectively ruled out sepsis in 32 neonates within 8 h of sample collection compared to blood culture, which took 24 h. The method may not replace blood culture but can be used to complement it.",

This study aimed to examine the characteristics of patients with ataxia after stroke based on their motor function to identify variables associated with fall occurrence. We divided 33 participants who presented with ataxia after stroke into fall and non-fall groups. Data on motor function, cognitive function, and daily functionality were extracted from their admission records. Walking ability was measured as comfortable walking speed and Stride Time Variability (STV). Independent sample <i>t</i>-tests, Mann - Whitney U tests, and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed. There were significant differences between fallers and non-fallers in the STV (<i>p</i> < .001), Mini-Balance Evaluations Systems Test score (<i>p</i> < .014) and Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score assessment (<i>p</i> < .028). In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only STV was associated with an increased risk of falls (<i>p</i> < .02). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.839; the cutoff value of gait cycle variability for falls was 6.345% (sensitivity, 80.0%; specificity, 74.0%). Increased stride time variability is a useful indicator that sensitively captures fall risk in patients with ataxia after stroke.",

    "abstract": "Partial separation of a peripheral population may lead to its divergence and, potentially, speciation due to genetic drift followed by selection and geographic isolation. This process may cause taxonomic uncertainty because reproductive isolation in allopatry cannot be verified directly. The two Nearctic allopatric species of magpies (Aves, Corvidae: <i>Pica</i>) serve as a good example of these problems. The Black-billed magpie <i>Pica hudsonia</i> is widely distributed in North America, whereas the Yellow-billed Magpie <i>Pica nuttalli</i> is endemic to a restricted range in California. Their relationships with Palearctic species have been little studied. We obtained complete mitochondrial genomes of both Nearctic magpie species, along with the Eurasian Magpie (<i>Pica pica</i>) and the Oriental Magpie (<i>Pica serica</i>), 20 mitogenomes in total. Phylogenetic analysis reveals a basal position of <i>P. serica</i>, and <i>P. pica</i> as a sister clade to the two Nearctic species. <i>P. hudsonia</i> and <i>P. nuttalli</i> form reciprocal monophyletic subclades, showing recent divergence between and within them. Our data show that the Nearctic magpie lineage diverged from the common ancestor with <i>P. pica</i>, with a single migration wave via the Beringia. Within the Nearctic, we hypothesize a peripatric mode of speciation among <i>Pica</i> taxa due to the divergence and separation of the small marginal population in California below the Sierra-Nevada mountains. Diversifying amino acid substitutions in <i>ND4-ND5-ND6</i> genes along the branch leading to the New World clade may indicate selection for heat-tolerance. Considering the clear phenotypic differences between <i>P. hudsonia</i> and <i>P. nuttalli</i>, our data, showing their reciprocal monophylies and genetic distinctness, is consistent with the two-species taxonomy.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to human and animal health, and antimicrobial use selects for AMR. Appropriate selection of antimicrobial drugs is an important part of veterinary education, but many veterinary students report that they have knowledge gaps in this area. Students with greater self-efficacy, the belief that one can perform the individual steps that comprise a task, tend to expend more effort and motivation in learning new skills. Educational activities that improve self-efficacy can increase student motivation, but appropriate assessment tools tailored for specific educational domains are necessary to support these efforts. The purpose of this study was to validate an online survey instrument to measure veterinary student self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection. The secondary goal was to determine if clinical training increases veterinary students' self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection. A total of 380 students from seven veterinary colleges in the United States completed an online survey instrument that asked students to self-assess their abilities to perform 13 tasks associated with antimicrobial selection on a 10-point Likert-type scale. A principal components analysis identified three factors associated with self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection: (a) empirical selection and dosing of antimicrobials, (b) identification of trustworthy resources and resistance to pressure to prescribe, and (c) knowledge of when antimicrobials are needed. Self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection increases the most in the fourth year of veterinary training. However, exposure to at least one clinical rotation was not associated with higher self-efficacy for selection of antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Examples of group B red cells that react weakly or not at all with anti-B have been described. Subgroups of B such as B<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>x</sub>, B<sub>m</sub>, and B<sub>el</sub> are rare and are less frequently reported. We studied the frequency of subgroups of B in our healthy blood donor population and serologically characterized and differentiated these subgroups. The 9-year prospective study included 84,534 healthy blood donors. Initial blood grouping and antibody screening of all donor samples were performed using automated solid-phase assay. Any sample showing blood group discrepancy or weaker agglutination was subjected to further immunohematological investigations. Among 84,534 healthy donors, \"B\" blood group was found in 29,190 (34.53%). Weak B phenotypes were demonstrated in 9 (0.031%) B donors. Among the 9 weak B phenotypes, B<sub>3</sub> was the most common followed by B<sub>m</sub>. The frequency of B<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>m</sub>, B<sub>x</sub>, and B<sub>el</sub> in our blood donor population was found to be 1 in 21,133, 1 in 28,178, 1 in 84,534, and 1 in 84,534, respectively. Red cell agglutination with anti-B and anti-AB varied from Wk+ to 2+ with or without mixed-field agglutination in the B<sub>3</sub> and B<sub>x</sub> phenotypes. Naturally occurring anti-B of immunoglobulin M type was detected in the B<sub>x</sub> donor. Two (22.2%) of the 9 donors were found to be nonsecretor. Adsorption-elution demonstrated \"B\" antigen specificity in different strengths in B<sub>m</sub>, B<sub>x</sub>, and B<sub>el</sub> phenotypes. We conclude that differentiating weak subgroups of \"B\" by serological assays is possible to a great extent with technical expertise. Mistyping weak subgroups of B as \"O\" group may lead to reporting errors and wrong blood transfusion. Therefore, blood centers in developing countries including India should establish simple techniques to detect and differentiate weak subgroups and develop procedures to ensure safe blood transfusion and transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Toronto has for 70 years been one of the fastest growing city-regions in North America, and over the last two decades has seen booming high-rise intensification. A distinctive land value capture (LVC) system and practice has emerged. This paper traces the contested evolution of Toronto LVC since 1946, including recent major changes to the rules, and makes three main contributions: First is the suggestion that at its core, LVC is an attempt to purposefully alter the distribution of the costs and benefits of urban property development between public and private actors, and should be considered a key metric to evaluate the social equity of property development processes. Second, conjunctural analysis has recently emerged as an approach to reading the intersection of political, economic, social, and ideological processes that come together to produce historical changes in specific cases. I argue that Historical Institutionalism (HI) is a valuable complement to the conjunctural analysis approach in its focus on the genesis of and contestation over specific sets of institutions. HI provides a set of midlevel conceptual frameworks and research methods to identify major institutions, the actors involved, and institutional change mechanisms, processes, and patterns. I bring together two hitherto separate traditions of thought about conjunctures, that arising from Gramsci through Stuart Hall, and that developed in HI, arguing that HI brings analytical clarity to the comparative analysis of conjunctures. Third, the Toronto case is revealing of processes of institutional change, mechanisms supporting path dependence, and the urban impacts of globally hegemonic ideological conjunctures.",

They assess student achievement while helping students understand standards and challenges of the field. In this article, we describe the use of authentic assignments and class activities in a graduate-level nutrition policy course at a public university in North Carolina and evaluate outcomes related to students' knowledge, comfort, and confidence in engaging in nutrition policy-related activities. The course included a variety of authentic assignments and activities, including a group policy brief project, letter to a legislator, case studies, and an elevator pitch on a nutrition policy issue. During the fall of 2020, students enrolled in two sections of the course (N=72) were invited to complete a pre- and post-survey. Thirty-five students (49%) completed both surveys and were included in the analyses. There were significant increases in students' comfort and confidence for engaging in nutrition policy-related activities. Students also appeared to have gained a better understanding of how they and/or their future profession are impacted by nutrition policy and how they and/or their future profession can play a role in nutrition policy. Authentic assignments may be helpful for preparing students to participate in the nutrition policy process.",

    "abstract": "Adherence to medical regimens, including medications and appointments, is a significant concern for adolescent populations that warrants behavioral interventions. Negative health behaviors during adolescence can persist into adulthood and lead to long-term negative health outcomes. Due to the limited availability and resources for behavioral self-management intervention, many youth do not receive evidence-based behavioral care and continue to struggle with managing their illness. Therefore, there is a need for easily accessible mHealth interventions targeting self-management in order to reduce health care barriers and provide more timely and effective behavioral care particularly during this developmental stage. We provide a description of the design and methodology of the Self-Management Assistance for Recommended Treatment (SMART) IBD App randomized controlled pilot trial in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that aims to test the preliminary efficacy of the SMART IBD app compared to a usual care (UC) arm. Thirty participants 13-17 years of age will be recruited and randomized in the trial. Those randomized to the intervention arm will use the app for four weeks, each with one weekly challenge that focuses on self-management. Participants in both arms will complete baseline assessments, daily diaries for four weeks, and post-treatment assessments. We hypothesize that participants in the intervention arm will experience clinically significant improvements in their self-management compared to those in the UC arm at the post-treatment assessment. Findings from the current study could provide initial evidence to support self-management interventions in adolescents with health conditions via mobile health apps, thereby reducing health care barriers and strains on institutional and nursing resources. Mobile health apps may also be a preferred avenue to disseminate interventions to adolescents.",

    "abstract": "There is growing recognition of the connection between ecosystem conservation and human health. For example, protection of tropical forests can affect the spread of infectious diseases, water quality, and dietary diversity, while forest loss can have important consequences for respiratory health due to the use of fire for converting land to alternative uses in many countries. Studies demonstrating links between ecosystems and health often conclude with recommendations to expand policies that protect natural ecosystems. However, there is little empirical evidence on the extent to which conservation policies actually deliver health benefits when they are implemented in real contexts. We estimate the effects of protected areas (PAs), the dominant type of conservation policy, on hospitalizations for respiratory illness in the Brazilian Amazon biome. We find that doubling upwind PAs reduces PM<sub>2.5</sub> by 10% and respiratory hospitalizations by 7% in the months of most active biomass burning. Brazil has an extensive network of PAs, but investments in management and enforcement have declined in recent years. Forest fires have increased dramatically over the same period. We estimate that the value of the health benefits exceed current average expenditures on PA management for the 1/3 of PAs with the largest local populations, although not for PAs in more remote locations. Our findings highlight how quantifying the contributions to the wellbeing of local populations can support conservation objectives, even if global environmental benefits are not a high priority for decision makers.",

Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate risk factors associated with burn site colonization. <b>Results:</b> The sample included <i>N</i> = 634 participants. Most were male (72.1%), with a flame injury (62%), and had a mean age of 47.6 (±18.0) years and a TBSA of 13.5% (±14.8). The incidence of positive burn wound colonization was 27.3%. Increasing participant age, diabetic status, larger burn TBSA, presence of full-thickness burns, inhalation injury, and lower limb and trunk involvement were associated with statistically significant (<i>P</i> ≤ .05) increased odds of a positive burn wound culture. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides an estimate of the incidence of primary burn wound colonization at a single, tertiary care, burn center as well as identifies potential risk factors associated with this outcome. Clinicians should consider closely monitoring patients with these risk factors for possible progression to clinical burn site infection. Future research should address strategies to mitigate colonization in patients with identified risk factors.",

    "abstract": "The underlying shoulder pathology in radiographic superior escape of the humeral head and association between acromiohumeral interval (AHI) on radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are poorly understood. A retrospective review of shoulder radiographs and MRI scans was undertaken. AHI was measured using both modalities. Deltoid bulk, long head of biceps brachii subluxation/tear, and rotator cuff disease (tendon involvement, severity, fatty infiltration) were noted using MRI. A total of 167 patients were included. MRI measurements of AHI were significantly smaller than radiographic measurements (<i>p</i> = 0.010). AHI was significantly smaller in patients with at least one partial or full thickness rotator cuff tear (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and in patients with increased fatty infiltration based on Goutallier grade (<i>p</i> = 0.004). In the presence of two or more tendon tears, long head of biceps brachii rupture was associated with superior escape (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In patients with superior escape (AHI <6 mm), the number of rotator cuff tendon tears ranged from 0 to 3 and Goutallier grades from 0 to 4 representing a wide disease spectrum. Radiographic superior escape of the humeral head is correlated with full thickness rotator cuff tears, fatty infiltration, and long head of biceps brachii rupture. However, superior escape can occur with a single or no tendon injury with minimal fatty infiltration. Level III; Retrospective Case-Control Design; Prognosis Study.",

    "abstract": "Police officers encounter individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) during their routine work and are often called to the scene of overdoses. Despite this frequency, officer knowledge and attitudes about addiction, treatment, and harm reduction vary. Views held by officers, and the extent of their knowledge, can impact the decisions they make regarding people with OUD, yet our understanding of these factors is limited. Using stratified random sampling, we surveyed 248 officers from 27 Illinois police departments on their knowledge of addiction and the means to address it. We performed descriptive and regression analyses to examine differences based on officer characteristics. We found a high proportion of officers lacked knowledge of addiction, treatment, and harm reduction. Our findings suggest the need for police training to improve understanding of addiction. Community collaboration and coordination of resources may give officers the tools to better address OUD, reduce harm, and decrease overdose.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers are promising materials for light-emitting devices due to their excellent electric and optical properties. However, defects are inevitably introduced in the fabrication of TMDC monolayers, significantly influencing their emission properties. Although photoluminescence (PL) is considered as an effective tool for investigating the defects in TMDC monolayers. However, the PL from the defect-bound excitons is revealed only at low temperatures. Here, we show that the PL from the defect-bound excitons in a WS<sub>2</sub> monolayer can be effectively revealed at room temperature by exploiting the transverse electric polarized wave supported by a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/Ag heterostructure. It is revealed that the defect-bound excitons in all possible positions of the WS<sub>2</sub> monolayer can be effectively excited by the TE wave with significantly enhanced in-plane electric field localized on the surface of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> layer. In addition, the emission from defect-bound excitons can propagate to the collection point with small attenuation. More importantly, the exciton dynamics in the WS<sub>2</sub> monolayer can be modified by the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/Ag heterostructure, allowing the simultaneous excitation of neutral excitons, charge excitons (trions), and defect-bound excitons in the WS<sub>2</sub> monolayer attached on the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/Ag heterostructure. We inspect the PL spectra obtained at different positions and find that the relative intensity of defect-bound excitons depends on the collection position. We also examine the dependences of the PL intensity and bandwidth on the excitation power for the three types of excitons. It is found that they exhibit different behaviors from those observed in the optical measurements by using the traditional excitation method. Our findings suggest a new way for exciting and studying the dynamics of multi-excitons at room temperature and indicate the potential applications of the TE wave in probing the defects in TMDC monolayers.",

    "abstract": "Children with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)(ventilation delivered through an endotracheal tube), often require 24/7 monitoring and care by skilled caregivers in order to stay safely within the home environment. Practice standards recommend skilled in-home nursing to maintain safe monitoring practices. However, across the country, a lack of home health nurses trained to care for children with IMV threatens the safety of this high-risk population. Despite this shortage, the vast majority of children with IMV do live at home. With great personal sacrifice, health system deficiencies are filled by parents, primarily mothers, in their roles as parent, primary nurse, care coordinator, therapist, educator, and advocate, and thus avoid readmissions and health system crises. Their contribution to fill health system gaps, by necessity, is often in contradiction to safe work hour recommendations for healthcare workers. These magic mothers and fathers make potential crises \"disappear\" out of sheer grit and determination to keep their children home. The long-term impacts of health service gaps on family systems must be considered and innovative solutions enacted to support these vulnerable children and families.",

The final product was characterised by a bright orange-yellow colour, a distinct hawthorn taste and odour, and a gelatinous consistency. Evaluation of the product based on organoleptic, physicochemical, and microbiological indicators showed that it had high nutritional and physiological value due to its retention of native micronutrients, high content of potassium, magnesium, and calcium, and antioxidant activity. The use of this product in a daily diet can satisfy the daily need for physiologically active substances and food ingredients. Overall, the use of natural puree from wild hawthorn fruit in the technology of jelly confiture allows for the expansion of raw material sources in the production of confectionery products with high nutritional and physiological value.",

Circulatory diseases were the main cause of death, representing 23% of deaths. External causes and respiratory diseases contributed 16% and 9% of deaths, respectively; 52.6% of infant deaths occurred in the early neonatal period, and the infant mortality rate remained above the national average. The ratio of maternal mortality was also high and above the national average between 2010 and 2021. The dengue incidence rate remained below the national average with a drop trend of -59.50%. However, rates of Chagas disease, AIDS, Hansen's disease, American cutaneous leishmaniasis and tuberculosis remained above average rates in the country. It was concluded that the population of the Brazilian Amazon faces health challenges. The findings facilitate the identification of territorial priorities for the implementation of actions that impact morbidity and mortality reduction in the region.",

    "abstract": "The multiple mini-interview (MMI) format assesses candidates' performance in various competencies and is becoming commonplace in medical school and residency programs. This interview format compares to and surpasses the traditional interview in validity, reliability, feasibility, and acceptability. We developed a MMI to assess resident and specialty intern candidates for Small Animal Internal Medicine over a 3-year period. Our aims were to assess acceptability by obtaining impressions from interviewers and candidates of the MMI process and to evaluate feasibility by quantifying time required. In total, 61 resident candidates completed the survey, a response rate of 70% of total interviewees. Respondents reported the MMI as more stressful (82%, 95% CI: 70%, 91%) and less enjoyable (62%, 95% CI: 49%, 74%). While 54% (95% CI: 41%, 67%) of respondents preferred a traditional interview process, 70% (95% CI: 57%, 81%) perceived that the MMI was fairer and 51% (95% CI: 38%, 64%) felt it allowed them to better demonstrate their strengths. Most (63%, 95% CI: 49%, 75%) reported that their experience with the MMI would lead them to rank the program more highly. Interviewers preferred the MMI process due to improved perceived fairness and time efficiency. MMI required less total time, 29.5 hours versus 112 hours for the traditional interview over 3-years (<i>p</i> = .002) and lower per applicant time investment (.34 hours/applicant vs. 1.2 hours/applicant, <i>p</i> = .0001). In conclusion, the MMI process was acceptable to interviewees, preferred by interviewers, and was feasible in terms of time savings compared to traditional interviews.",

    "abstract": "Volatiles produced by the leaves of medicinal plants are increasingly used as a new plant disease management strategy due to their induction of diverse antimicrobial activities, it is highly essential for the development of a new phyto-fumigant product to sustain crop production. The present study attempted to find the active role of <i>Mentha spicata-</i>associated volatile formulation in the suppression of the growth of <i>Pythium aphanidematum</i> under pot culture and field conditions. Damping off disease-causing <i>P. aphanidermatum</i> is a devastating disease that infects the tomato crop from seed sprouting to the seedling stage. To mitigate the damping off incidence, the nature of volatile molecules produced by <i>M. spicata</i> was completely suppressed during di-trophic interaction with <i>P. aphanidermatum</i>. Molecular docking of volatile compound reported carvone as a ligand recorded with the highest binding energy of - 8.5 kcal/mol against the target protein structure of <i>P. aphanidermatum.</i> Application of <i>M. spicata</i> immobilized vermiculite ball in tomato revealed that pathogenesis-related protein (<i>Sl</i>PR1) (2.69 folds) and jasmonic acid signaling (<i>Sl</i>LOX) (2.65 folds) genes were highly expressed after 48 HPT on tri-trophic interaction of pathogen inoculated tomato plants while the gene <i>Sl</i>WRKY and <i>Sl</i>TLP exhibited a lower level of gene expression. A significant reduction in the severity of damping off incidence was observed due to the exposure of volatiles of <i>M. spicata</i> in the tomato plant's raised beds with relatively abundant control of <i>P. aphanidematum.</i> This is the first study that attempted to develop the volatile-based formulation and its role in antifungal activities during di-trophic interaction with <i>P. aphanidematum</i> in tomato crops. The present study concludes that the volatiles produced from <i>M. spicata</i> leaves immobilized vermiculite ball could be explored for the management of soil-borne pathogens infecting vegetable crops.

    "abstract": "Changes in the environment or novel procedures can result in altered cow behavior during data collection; training is often recommended to ensure accurate data is being recorded. Currently, little is known regarding the habituation of dairy cows during methane emission testing with the GreenFeed emission monitoring system (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD), or how behavior relates to enteric methane emission measurements. Methane emissions were estimated from a total of 202 Holstein dairy cows (120-150 d in milk) housed in tiestalls as part of a larger project. Cows were tested on d 0 (training day) and d 1-5 (test day) for approximately 10 min, during which behavior was recorded by a trained observer. While cows spent more time with their head outside of the machine on the training day (d 0) than during the test days (d 1-5), the opposite pattern was observed for the number of leg movements. No differences in estimated methane production were found over the different days, though it was negatively correlated with both behaviors. These results highlight the importance of habituation of dairy cows to the GreenFeed system for methane measurements to minimize changes to cow behavior under tiestall conditions, whereas the methane emissions themselves are less affected. However, further research is needed to determine the impact of cow behavior on the reliability and repeatability of methane emission measurements as it may introduce bias in genetic evaluations for methane efficiency.",

Among SSD patients, we found a higher recognition of criminal irresponsibility (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Patients with PD were more likely to engage in violent behavior in the REMS than their SSD counterparts (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Patients with SSD were more likely to receive antipsychotic polypharmacy (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and a higher dose of antipsychotics (p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy converters hold substantial potential in converting thermal radiation from high-temperature emitters into electrical energy through photovoltaic (PV) cells, offering applications ranging from solar energy harvesting to waste heat recovery. Near-field TPV (NF-TPV) devices, focused on enhancing power output density (POD), exhibit unique potential by harnessing photon tunneling. However, this potential can be mitigated by additional losses arising from high photocurrent densities and corresponding scalability issues. This study comprehensively investigates the effectiveness of multi-junction-based NF-TPV devices, accounting for additional losses. We propose two approximative expressions to quantify the impact of additional losses and characterize current density-voltage curves. Verification against rigorously optimized results establishes a criterion for effective performance. Our method provides precise POD estimations even for devices with 10 or more subcells, facilitating performance analysis across parameters like vacuum gap distance, cell width, emitter temperature, and the number of subcells compared to far-field counterparts. This research outlines a roadmap for the scalable design of NF-TPV devices, emphasizing the role of multi-junction PV cells. The analytical framework we developed will provide vital insights for future high-performance TPV devices.",

    "abstract": "Vibrational polaritons have shown potential in influencing chemical reactions, but the exact mechanism by which they impact vibrational energy redistribution, crucial for rational polariton chemistry design, remains unclear. In this work, we shed light on this aspect by revealing the role of solvent phonon modes in facilitating the energy relaxation process from the polaritons formed of a <i>T</i> <sub>1<i>u</i></sub> mode of W(CO)<sub>6</sub> to an IR inactive <i>E</i> <sub><i>g</i></sub> mode. Ultrafast dynamic measurements indicate that along with the direct relaxation to the dark <i>T</i> <sub>1<i>u</i></sub> modes, lower polaritons also transition to an intermediate state, which then subsequently relaxes to the <i>T</i> <sub>1<i>u</i></sub> mode. We reason that the intermediate state could correspond to the near-in-energy Raman active <i>E</i> <sub><i>g</i></sub> mode, which is populated through a phonon scattering process. This proposed mechanism finds support in the observed dependence of the IR-inactive state's population on the factors influencing phonon density of states, e.g., solvents. The significance of the Raman mode's involvement emphasizes the importance of non-IR active modes in modifying chemical reactions and ultrafast molecular dynamics.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objective</b>  The assessment of baseline olfactory function before endoscopic skull base surgery (ESBS) has been relatively limited compared with analysis before functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Our study addresses this knowledge gap, assessing preoperative olfactory function in ESBS and FESS and elucidating any differences. <b>Study Design</b>  We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing anterior ESBS or FESS at a single institution between 2021 and 2022. We included 171 patients and compared their reported and measured preoperative olfactory function using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test questionnaire and the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. <b>Results</b>  Of the 171 patients included in this study, 30% of patients underwent ESBS and 70% underwent FESS. Of all patients, only 57% correctly reported their objective preoperative olfactory function. Of the 36 ESBS patients with measured preoperative hyposmia, only 31% correctly reported hyposmia, while 69% incorrectly reported normosmia. This distribution significantly differs ( <i>p</i>  < 0.0001) from the FESS subset (89 patients), with 64% correctly reporting hyposmia and 36% incorrectly reporting normosmia. <b>Conclusion</b>  Our analysis demonstrates higher than anticipated underreporting of preoperative hyposmia in patients undergoing ESBS as well as discrepancies between subjective and objective olfactory functions in the FESS population. The results highlight several gaps in knowledge regarding perioperative olfactory function that would be best examined with more thorough pre- and postoperative objective olfactory testing. This analysis demonstrates significant prognostic uncertainty for patients and providers and creates significant medicolegal uncertainty regarding the appropriate attribution of postoperative olfactory loss in cases without objective preoperative testing.",

    "title": "Clients' perceptions of motivational interviewing with couples: A qualitative examination of male couples' statements to counselors in session.",
    "abstract": "The past two decades have seen expanding interest in the application of Motivational Interviewing (MI) with couples. Thus far, literature detailing the development of MI with couples has focused primarily on elucidating counseling processes and techniques or on evaluating intervention effects. To date no published studies have examined client-perceptions of the counseling process in MI with couples. This study involved qualitative analysis of 55 sessions from 24 couple (48 individuals) who received short (3-session) courses of MI with couples in the context of a randomized controlled trial. All participants identified as cisgender male and were 18 or older. In each couple, at least one partner was aged 18 to 29, HIV negative, and reported drug use in the past 30 days. Analysis revealed that client couples attributed the benefits of MI with couples to the expectancy-related effects s (merely structuring time to talk) and common factors (the presence of the counsellor as a non-judgmental observer). Clients also conveyed appreciation for techniques and activities that enhanced dyadic functioning through communication skill building and the identification of shared values. Finally, clients appreciated the opportunity to discuss drug use and sexual behavior in an integrated way. Findings indicate the utility of counselor-delivered behavioral interventions. They also align with recent formulations of the counselor's role in MI with couples as well as the introduction of facilitating dyadic functioning as a distinct process. Finally, they highlight the potential value of training counselors to address the intersection of drug use, sexual risk, and sexual pleasure in sessions. These dimensions of practice receive inconsistent attention across counseling training program curricula.",

    "title": "Internalized Mental Illness Stigma is Linked to Suicidality in Rural Indian Adults with Depression or Anxiety and Chronic Physical Illness.",
    "abstract": "Mental illness (MI) remains stigmatized globally, including in India, where suicide and suicidality have been rising. Internalization of society's negative stereotypes by people with MI is known as internalized MI stigma. The present paper examined the prevalence of internalized MI stigma in a large sample of rural Indian participants with comorbid chronic medical conditions and previously undiagnosed, mostly mild-to-moderate depression/anxiety. It further examined correlates of internalized MI stigma and its association with suicidality. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at four-time points with adults with depression/anxiety and chronic physical illness in primary health centers in Ramanagaram, Karnataka. Topics included demographics, social support, depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scale), anxiety (7-item General Anxiety Disorder scale), suicidality (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview), and internalized MI stigma (Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness [ISMI] scale). Data analysis included linear and hierarchical logistic regression. At baseline, 29.1% of participants showed a high level of internalized stigma, and 10.4% exhibited at least moderate suicidality. Hierarchical logistic regression showed that every 1-point increase on the ISMI scale more than tripled the odds of moderate to high suicidality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.24). Those being at least moderately depressed/anxious were 2.4 times more likely to be at least moderately suicidal than participants with no-mild depression/anxiety. Social support lowered the odds of suicidality (AOR 0.44). Internalized MI stigma and suicidality were substantial among these rural adults with mostly mild-to-moderate anxiety/depression. Higher stigma was associated with increased suicidality, independently of depression/anxiety. Therefore, efforts to reduce internalized MI stigma should be included in mental health treatment.",

    "abstract": "Although alcohol use is related to daily affect, findings regarding affect variability-the degree to which individuals exhibit day-to-day fluctuations in affect-and alcohol use have been mixed. The present study assessed whether individuals who use alcohol tend to have higher positive and negative affect variability than individuals who do not, as well as whether higher affect variability is related to more frequent and intense alcohol use among individuals who use alcohol. We also explored whether affect variability differed between individuals who use alcohol and those who concurrently use alcohol and cannabis. College students (<i>N</i>=1909; <i>M=</i>20.1, <i>SD=</i>1.3; 67.7% female; 76.6% white; <i>n</i>=1147 individuals who use alcohol) completed a 21-day protocol between February-December 2021 in which they reported daily affect, number of drinks consumed, and any cannabis use. As hypothesized, individuals who used alcohol had higher positive and negative affect variability than individuals who did not. Among individuals who used alcohol, individuals with higher negative affect variability drank alcohol more frequently, and both higher positive and negative affect variability were related to more intense alcohol use. No differences emerged between individuals who used alcohol and those who concurrently used alcohol and cannabis. Taken together, higher positive and negative affect variability were related to higher odds of using alcohol and more frequent and intense use among individuals who use alcohol, over and above average affect. Higher affect variability could relate to alcohol use because of difficulties with emotion regulation or heightened sensitivity to the environment.",

    "abstract": "There is growing recognition that water insecurity - the inability to reliably access sufficient water for all household uses - is commonly experienced globally and has myriad adverse consequences for human well-being. The role of water insecurity in food insecurity and diet quality, however, has received minimal attention. Data are from panel surveys conducted during 2020-21 among adults involved in smallholder agriculture in Niger (n = 364, 3 rounds), Nigeria (n = 501, 5 rounds), Senegal (n = 501, 5 rounds), and Ghana (n = 543, 5 rounds). We hypothesized that household water insecurity (measured using the brief Household Water Insecurity Experiences Scale) would be associated with greater individual food insecurity (using 5 of the 8 Food Insecurity Experiences Scale items) and lower dietary diversity (using the Minimum Dietary Diversity Score for Women). At baseline, 37.1% of individuals were living in water-insecure households and of these, 90.6% had some experience of food insecurity. In multilevel mixed-effects regressions, individuals living in water-insecure households had 1.67 (95% CI: 1.47, 1.89) times higher odds of reporting any food insecurity experience and were estimated to consume 0.38-fewer food groups (95% CI: -0.50, -0.27) than those living in water-secure households. Experiences with suboptimal water access and use are associated with poor nutrition. The pathways by which water insecurity impacts nutrition should be identified. Global and national food and nutrition security policies could be strengthened by monitoring and developing strategies to address household water insecurity.",

However, the relationship of spinal tumor and COVID-19 longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) coexistence has never been reported in our knowledge. The clinical presentation and response to treatment of a 24-year-old female patient diagnosed with COVID-19 LETM and anaplastic ependymoma are described in this case report. The Patient's cerebrospinal fluid COVID-19 antibody level was higher than serum and she was resistant to immunosuppressive treatment. The interaction between COVID-19 and spinal tumor was discussed in the light of the literature. It is thought that COVID-19 infection could trigger tumor growth in this patient. Also, this is the first case of anaplastic ependymoma and COVID-19 myelitis coexistence in the literature.",

    "abstract": "This article traces the leisure travel of British homosexual men in continental Europe between 1950 and 1975. The aim of this article is to challenge narratives of British post-war sexual rights discourses as isolated from continental Europe. Taking a transnational approach, which examines the ways in which Britain was embedded in processes of social and cultural change across Europe, it charts informal encounters and networks of cultural communication forged by homosexual men themselves during the post-war tourist boom. Using Oral Histories deposited at the British Library Sound Archive, I emphasize the role of homosocial spaces in the production and performance of the sexual self and establish how affluence provided access to spaces for sexual self-development during a period when homosexuality remained criminalized in Britain. It explores two distinct types of holidays taken by homosexual travellers, examined via a life writing approach-the Amsterdam city break and the southern European beach holiday-and shows how these experiences shaped their self-conception and hopes for a more tolerant society at home. In revealing how foreign forms of homosexual sociability influenced domestic politics, I argue for a stronger emphasis on British entanglements with continental Europe when tracing political and social transformations during the post-war period.",

    "abstract": "The scope of this study was to identify and analyze the social representations of Primary Health Care users of the SUS in the Federal District (FD) with respect to COVID-19 in the context of the Pandemic. It involved a qualitative study based on Social Representation Theory (SRT) that analyzed 1,713 interviews with Iramuteq software users. The Descending Hierarchical Classification (DHC) procedure distributed 85.79% of the word sets associated with COVID-19 into five lexical groupings. The main representations of the COVID-19 pandemic for PHC users in the FD are fear and death. The lack of coordination of the health system, which required governance by the State, made it difficult for people to receive care in a timely manner. Historically excluded social segments, particularly the black, mixed-race and economically vulnerable population, experienced the most severe impact, including loss of life. Overcoming the conflict between an austere and minimally effective State prevailing at the time of the pandemic, and the need to build a solidarity-based health system in a society with major socio-economic disparities, was crucial in ensuring that health in the post-COVID-19 era, as a human right and value, remained at the center of the debate on the Bioethics of Intervention.",

This study was conducted on the general population in Karachi to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding N. fowleri. Data was collected using a questionnaire with four parts, covering demographics, N. fowleri knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices. The sample size of 400 was determined using the Raosoft Survey Tool. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0, including descriptive analysis and the Pearson chi-square test. Non-probability convenience sampling was used. The study period was June-December 2022. This study showed that around 80% of people had never heard about N. fowleri. This study revealed the level of awareness of N. fowleri and measures to avoid its infection in Karachi is very low, where N. fowleri infections are reported every year. Hence, appropriate measures should be taken to increase knowledge and awareness to avoid the spread of N. fowleri infection among the population.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the role of SCN1A gene polymorphism in developing drug resistance in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) patients, along with increased oxidative stress. The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Delhi, India. We recruited 100 patients diagnosed with IGE patients, grouped as drug-resistant and drug-responsive, and then further compared the SCN1A SNP rs10167228 A*/T analysis between the two groups. We utilized the PCR-RFLP technique to investigate the association between polymorphisms and refractory epilepsy. Serum HMGB1 levels were estimated using the ELISA technique to analyze oxidative stress in both groups. rs10167228 A*/T polymorphism genotypes AT and AA genotypes are significantly associated with an increased risk of developing drug resistance. Serum HMGB1, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in drug-resistant cases, compared to the drug-responsive group. The association of SCN1A gene polymorphisms, in conjunction with raised oxidative stress, may be predictive of the development of drug-resistant epilepsy. The AT and AA genotypes of rs10167228 may pose a risk factor for developing drug-resistant epilepsy.",

APM extract contained 0.559% w/w apigenin. Spectroscopic analysis confirmed apigenin with m/z value of 271.3. This method has been reported for the first time and proven accurate, precise and specific. As apigenin is a promising therapeutic agent, the established method can be used for quality control and be a template for drug formulation.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy-related acute kidney injury (PRAKI) causes substantial maternofoetal health burden in developing countries. The causes of PRAKI are diverse, important ones being haemorrhage, sepsis and preeclampsia in developing countries. A retrospective study was conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and Nephrology in an Indian tertiary care hospital from 2017 to 2019. All patients admitted to Obstetric Critical Care Unit (CCU-Obs) who were pregnant or less than 42 days postpartum, with acute kidney injury and required haemodialysis were enrolled in the study and analysed for risk factors and causes of PRAKI. PRAKI occurred in 6.21% admissions in CCU-Obs and 37.42% of these patients required dialysis. Majority were unbooked (85.9%) and referred (65.6%) from other hospitals; 57.8% patients developed AKI postnatally. The main causes for AKI in the current study were prerenal causes (84.4%) like obstetric haemorrhage due to placental abruption and post-partum haemorrhage. Other important causes were severe preeclampsia (23.4%) and sepsis (39%). Many patients had more than one condition leading to AKI. Patients needed 4.98 (average) cycles of dialysis and the average duration of stay in the hospital was 16.89 days. Maternal mortality was seen in a third of the cases, owing to complications of AKI. Preterm delivery was seen in 44%; stillbirth in half the cases and neonatal deaths in a quarter of them. To conclude, the  leading causes of PRAKI requiring dialysis were obstetric haemorrhage, sepsis and preeclampsia. Prompt management and timely referral to a higher institute will decrease the incidence of PRAKI and its complications.",

The Lifetime Impact Study for Achondroplasia (LISA), aimed to assess health-related quality of life and medical resource utilization among Latin America patients with achondroplasia. Data were collected from individuals aged 3 years and above in Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia between 2018 and 2021. A total of 172 patients participated in the study. Children with achondroplasia reported lower scores compared with average stature children in Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth (QoLISSY) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) questionnaires, with the greatest impact on physical and social domains. Among adolescents, a significant percentage reported pain, 10.3% experienced pain in 3 or more sites. Adults scored lower than the reference population in the EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Score, and a considerable portion reported moderate to severe anxiety/depression, pain or discomfort, and mobility problems. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) revealed poor health status in terms of energy, pain, and mobility. Medical events, particularly musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were reported, resulting in high medical resource utilization. Overall, the Lifetime Impact Study for Achondroplasia study provides extensive data on health-related quality of life, psychosocial impact, and health care resource utilization among individuals with achondroplasia in Latin America. The findings confirm a significant burden of illness across multiple domains for these individuals.",

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction</b>  A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to compare surgical treatment using open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with volar locking plates (VLP) to conservative treatment with closed reduction and immobilization in elderly patients aged ≥60 years with acute displaced distal radius fractures. <b>Methods</b>  A search of the MEDLINE, Scopus, and Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases was conducted. Clinical and radiographic measures at 12 months were compared between groups by pooling the mean difference. The complication rates were compared by pooling relative risk ratios. Pooled mean differences of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) results were compared with the published minimal clinically important difference (MCID) to evaluate the clinical relevance of the results. <b>Results</b>  The initial search yielded 766 records, from which 6 articles were selected for the final analysis. The results of the DASH questionnaire at 12 months of follow-up were significantly lower in the surgical treatment group with a mean difference (MD) of -3.61 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -6.48 to -0.73). No statistically significant difference was found in the PRWE questionnaire (MD = -3.14 points [95% CI: -7.32 to 1.04]). Radiological results were significantly better in the surgical treatment group and no significant difference in the overall complication rate between the groups was detected. Found MD for DASH and PRWE did not reach the published MCIDs. <b>Conclusion</b>  This study suggests that for elderly patients aged ≥60 years with acute displaced distal radius fractures, surgical treatment using ORIF with VLP does not provide clinically relevant benefits compared with conservative treatment with closed reduction and immobilization at the 12-month follow-up, despite demonstrating better radiological results.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the long-term efficacy and prognostic factors of partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical nephrectomy (RN) for T1bN0M0 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 12,471 patients diagnosed with T1bN0M0 RCC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2010 and 2019. Patients were divided into the PN and RN groups, and propensity score matching was conducted to balance the differences between the groups. We compared overall survival (OS), RCC cancer-specific mortality (CSM), and noncancer-specific mortality (NCSM) between the 2 groups. The risk factors for all-cause and RCC-related mortality were analyzed. After propensity score matching, there were 3817 patients in each group. After matching, OS and NCSM were significantly longer in the PN group (<i>p</i> < 0.001); however, there was no significant between-group difference in the RCC-CSM. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the PN group (HR, 0.671; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.579-0.778, <i>p</i> < 0.001), but PN was not associated with lower RCC-related mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that PN reduced the HR of all-cause mortality by 35% (HR, 0.647; 95% CI, 0.536-0.781; <i>p</i> < 0.001) in patients with 4.0- to 5.5-cm tumors compared with RN and by 29% (HR, 0.709; 95% CI, 0.559-0.899; <i>p</i> = 0.004) in those with larger tumors (5.6-7.0 cm). Multifactorial analysis showed that PN was an independent predictor of OS (HR, 0.671; 95% CI, 0.579-0.778; <i>p</i> < 0.001). In addition, multivariate analysis validated that age at diagnosis, sex, pathological grade, and tumor size were associated with outcomes. In patients with T1b RCC, PN resulted in better OS and NCSM outcomes than RN. The benefit of PN in all-cause mortality was pronounced in patients with 4.0-5.5 cm tumor loads. Therefore, individualized treatment schemes should prioritize PN, when technically feasible.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects approximately 15-20% of couples. Constitutional chromosomal abnormalities (CA) are an important cause of RPL because the gametes of carriers may have chromosomal imbalance which is lethal to the fetus. Therefore, the identification of CA helps to provide information about likely outcome of pregnancy in carriers. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and types of CA in RPL. The study group consisted of individuals with RPL seen at a tertiary care center in South India from 2001 to 2019, whose karyotypes were reviewed retrospectively. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on peripheral blood using standard protocols. The number of metaphases analyzed per patient was 20 and extended up to 50 for confirmation of low-level mosaicism. There were 3488 individuals (1663 couples and 162 where only partner was tested of whom 104 were females). The frequency of CA was 3.6% (127/3488) (M:F ratio of 1:2.6). Structural aberrations were seen in 2.5% (90/3488) and numerical aberrations of sex chromosomes in 1.1% (37/3488) of patients. Structural aberrations included 68 balanced translocations including one three-way translocation, seven inversions, one insertion and duplication each, and 14 Robertsonian translocations. There was one patient each with Turner syndrome (TS) and 47,XYY syndrome. We had 37 mosaics, comprising 29 with mosaic TS and 6 with triple X mosaicism and 2 with mosaicism for balanced translocation. The frequency of CA is comparable to the literature. We have described a few less commonly seen aberrations as well as sex chromosomal aneuploidies, almost all of which were due to low-level mosaicism.",

    "abstract": "To assess the contribution of germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in population-based series of breast cancers and the best strategy to improve detection rates. Three cohort studies were utilized, including a hospital-based series identified from new UK mainstream testing criteria (group-1), offering testing to all women (group-2-BReast CAncer [BRCA]-DIRECT), and a Greater Manchester cohort study recruited from the mammography screening population (group-3-Predicting Risk of Cancer at Screening). DNA samples from women with breast cancer were sequenced for PVs in <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, and Partner and Localiser of BRCA2 (<i>PALB2</i>). The Manchester score (MS) was used at different points thresholds. Current mainstream criteria include women diagnosed <40 years and all triple negative <60 years or an MS ≥15. Thirty-six PVs (<i>BRCA1</i> = 9<i>,</i> <i>BRCA2</i> = 18<i>, PALB2</i> = 9) were identified among 1061 women with breast cancer (3.4%). Mainstreaming criteria identified 21 of 36 (58%) of PVs by testing 190 women; detection rate (8.4%), specificity = 83.5%. A better detection rate was found using an MS threshold of 12-points with 66.7% (24/36) sensitivity and 85.7% specificity in 171 women. No PVs were identified in 158 women with grade-1 invasive cancers. The best strategy to detect all PVs was an MS ≥3 with specificity of 32.6%. In order to detect higher PV rates on a population basis the best strategy is to reduce the MS threshold for genetic testing.",

    "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence of the presence of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) within meningiomas (MGs). In the present study, we assessed the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of stem cell markers SOX2, OCT4, CD133 in different grades of MGs and their correlation with Ki 67 index. A cross-sectional analytical study where 140 MGs cases were graded and classified according to WHO-2021 classification. IHC for SOX2, OCT4, CD133 and Ki-67 was carried out. Out of 140 cases, 59 cases (42.1%) showed OCT4 positivity, 38 cases (27.1%) showed CD133 positivity and only 21 cases (15%) showed SOX2 positivity. Ki 67 index ranged from 1-30%. Statistically significant difference (Chi Square p-value <0.001) was found between SOX 2, OCT4 and CD133 expressions (positive/negative) and the grades of MG cases. As the grades of MG cases increased, the positive expression of SOX2, OCT 4 and CD 133 also increased. The Mean Ki 67 index value was significantly raised when SOX2, OCT 4 and CD 133 IHC expressions were positive (Student t Test p-value <0.001). Our results strongly support the hypothesis of presence of CSCs, in MGs regardless of their grade. We recommend that CSCs IHC markers (SOX2, OCT4 and CD133) to be used on initial diagnosis in all cases of MGs along with Ki-67 index. It can help quantitate CSCs and in turn, recommend closer follow up in patients with high percentage of CSCs to predict early recurrence.",

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Surgical treatment for scoliosis can be done for functional and esthetic concerns. Surgical intervention may be associated with a complication rate of up to 40% in patients with non-idiopathic scoliosis, and 3% in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. In the present study, the authors sought to evaluate patients undergoing surgery for scoliosis with closure by the plastic and reconstructive surgery service. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study was performed by extracting data, including demographics, surgical characteristics, and outcomes, from the electronic medical records of a single, large, tertiary care hospital and from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Data was collected for patients aged 18 to 75 undergoing spinal surgery for scoliosis from 2012 to 2020. Data collected from institutional records included only patients whose incision was closed by plastic and reconstructive surgery, while data from NSQIP was collected from all scoliosis surgery patients regardless of closure type. <b>Results:</b> A total of 98 scoliosis patients were identified who underwent closure by the plastic and reconstructive surgery service. These were compared to 1390 scoliosis patients in NSQIP for whom no specific closure details were noted. At 30-day post-operatively, readmission rates were 2.04% and 7.34% for the institutional and NSQIP cohorts, respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.041), reoperation rates were 1.04% and 5.83% for the institutional and NSQIP cohorts, respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.0384), and overall complication rates were 2.04% and 12.52% for the institutional and NSQIP cohorts, respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.0005). <b>Conclusion:</b> Surgical intervention for scoliosis may benefit from closure by the plastic and reconstructive surgery service, which may yield potential lower rates of readmission, reoperation, and post-operative complication.",

Previous literature has shown that admission to a trauma centre and coordinated management of early bony fixation and soft-tissue reconstruction improve patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to describe patients who had open tibial fractures in Ontario and analyse their outcomes. <b>Method:</b> Linked population-based administrative data pertaining to patients who had open tibia fractures between the years 2009 and 2020 were examined. Demographic information, admission location, timing of soft-tissue reconstruction, and complication rates were collected. <b>Results:</b> 4240 patients were identified. The mean age was 47, and the majority were males. One-third of the patients were admitted to a trauma centre. This group were more likely to have an Injury Severity Score >15, and associated neurovascular injuries of the leg. When outcomes were compared over 1 year, the trauma centre group was more likely to undergo limb amputation, but also more likely to have a soft-tissue reconstruction. The average time to soft-tissue reconstruction was 20 days. Patients receiving care in a trauma centre were more likely to have an external fixation, plastic surgery consults, and longer hospital stay. There were no differences in the odds of infection, malunion or nonunion, and 30-day mortality. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings provide a comprehensive examination of the clinical course for patients experiencing open tibia fractures in Ontario.

Furthermore, this research concludes that the health impacts of gentrification are heterogeneous and may have adverse impacts on Black Americans. However, existing gentrification and health research has not fully engaged with the racialized processes that produce these uneven impacts. To address this gap, we develop a conceptual framework to describe how gentrification may create unique experiences and differentiated health impacts for Black Americans. Applying a lens of racial capitalism, we examine how an ongoing legacy of structurally racist urban and housing policy in the United States has disinvested from and devalued Black communities; thereby rendering them vulnerable to subsequent reinvestment through gentrification. Next, we consider how this history creates unique health vulnerabilities to gentrification for Black residents. Finally, we describe pathways of displacement-physical and symbolic-through which these unique health vulnerabilities are shaped to produce differences in health.",

To determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in bipolar disorder patients and its clinico-demographic and homocysteine correlates, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 195 bipolar disorder inpatients. They received questionnaires, clinical measurements and laboratory tests to assess demographic characteristics, anthropometric variables, clinical variables and plasma homocysteine levels. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (including type 1, type 2 and special types) in Chinese bipolar disorder patients was 14.9%. Analysis of variance or chi-square test showed that compared with non-diabetic bipolar disorder patients, diabetic bipolar disorder patients were older, more often married, had a longer duration of disease, took less olanzapine and had a higher frequency of hypertension. However, there were no significant differences in body mass index (BMI) and homocysteine levels between diabetic and non-diabetic bipolar disorder patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that marital status and duration of disease were independently associated with diabetes mellitus in patients with bipolar disorder after controlling for age, use of olanzapine, presence of hypertension, BMI and homocysteine levels. These findings shed light on the clinico-demographic correlates of the increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus in bipolar disorder patients, rather than the correlation with some metabolic risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Recent scholarship has advanced a concept of racism operating through omission. Omission captures both inaction and action, highlighting how systems of oppression rely on inertia in addition to discriminatory action to perpetuate inequality. Yet little is known about how laypersons understand the role of omission in propagating racism in the US. Building on this foundational premise, we employ an innovative mixed-methods approach to document and test folk theories of the racism of omission. We first interview diverse individuals (N=40) about their appraisals of racism, and then use these findings to design a vignette study which we fielded to a national sample (N=1,174). Interview data reveal that some Americans do understand omission to be a form of racism, highlighting (1) bystander inaction, (2) silencing of experiences of racism, (3) overfocus on White issues, and (4) disparities in positions of power as instances where inaction, exclusion, or inertia constitute a form of racism. Vignette data show that Americans are most likely to consider overfocus and silencing as forms of omission-based racism, and that racism appraisals depend on the race of the victim. We also find that political ideology, gender, income, race/ethnicity, and education shape appraisals of racism as omission. These findings have important implications for measures of perceived racism and discrimination.",

    "title": "Braimah-Taiwo et al New Classification System and Treatment Algorithm of Mandibulo-Maxillary Synostosis Related to Noma. Field Experience From Noma Children Hospital Sokoto, Nigeria.",
    "abstract": "This was a retrospective study at Noma Children Hospital, Sokoto, Nigeria, from January 2018 to December 2021. The main objective of this appraisal was to present Braimah-Taiwo et al's new classification system for mandibulo-maxillary synostosis secondary to noma and also to provide a guide to their treatment. Noma with mandibulo-maxillary synostosis was the main inclusion criteria. Excluded were cases of acute noma and noma without mandibulo-maxillary synostosis. Data retrieved include demographics of patients and extent of bony ankylosis and mandibulo-maxillary synostosis. A total of 64 patients (30 (46.9%) males and 34 (53.1%) females) were managed. Ages ranged from 6 to 40 years with mean ± SD (18.2 ± 7.6) years. Regarding the new classification system of mandibulo-maxillary synostosis, 6 (9.4%) patients presented with Type 1 (Mild joint obliteration)±Soft tissue scarring, 24 (37.5%) presented with Type II (Total joint obliteration)±Soft tissue scarring, 21 (32.8%) presented with Type III (Coronoid, zygoma and maxilla) ±Soft tissue scarring, 4 (6.3%) presented with Type IV (Condyle, glenoid fossa, coronoid, sigmoid notch and zygoma) ±Soft tissue scarring, 7 (10.9%) presented with Type V (Condyle, glenoid fossa, coronoid, sigmoid notch, zygoma and pterygo-maxilla) ±Soft tissue scarring, while 2 (3.1%) patients presented with Type VI (condyle, glenoid fossa, coronoid, sigmoid notch, zygoma, pterygo-maxilla and the orbit) ±Soft tissue scarring. Pattern of tissue destruction in noma patients is complex involving both soft and hard tissues. This new classification will guide surgeons in the effective management of these patients.",

    "abstract": "With the use of Anti-D prophylaxis for rhesus D-negative pregnant women, other Rh and non-Rh allo-antibodies have become relatively more important. The index case reports severe hemolytic disease of the newborn due to anti-E antibody in a full-term baby boy born to a COVID-19-positive mother. The antibody screening of the mother performed during Booking of pregnancy at 9<sup>th</sup> week of gestation was negative. Subsequently the mother was lost to follow-up till delivery due to COVID pandemicity. At birth, the baby was icteric but non-hydropic, his direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was strong positive (4+ by column agglutination technology) and required top-up transfusion and phototherapy at Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Elution of DAT-positive red cells rendered anti-E which could have formed as \"late developing\" red cell allo-anti-E in the pregnancy. A repeat antibody screening around 28<sup>th</sup> week gestation is of prime importance to detect any underlying allo-antibody in a multigravida and thus enabling close monitoring of fetus and initiation of early management as desired.",

    "abstract": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Colpectomy entails the surgical removal of the vaginal epithelium. It may be performed in trans-masculine individuals as gender-affirming surgery. Vaginal colpectomy is a complex procedure with potentially severe complications. As alternative, robotic-assisted laparoscopic colpectomy combined with robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy and possible bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RAC+) can be performed. <b><i>Aim:</i></b> To compare surgical outcomes of robotic-assisted colpectomy combined with a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with a vaginal colpectomy after previous hysterectomy in trans masculine patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A single-center retrospective cohort study included 310 transgender men who underwent either robotic-assisted colpectomy combined with a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RAC+) (<i>n</i> = 140) or vaginal colpectomy (<i>n</i> = 170) between January 2006 and December 2019. Surgical details and clinical outcomes were collected from all patients. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The median intra-operative blood loss was 100 mL (50-200) in RAC + and 300 mL (200-450) in vaginal colpectomy (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The median duration of hospital stay was 2 days (1-2) in the RAC + group and 3 days (2-4) in the vaginal group (<i>p</i> < 0.01). In the RAC + group 63 (45%) peri-operative complications were reported, compared to 93 (54.7%) in the vaginal group [OR 0.7 (0.4-1.1)]. The main difference was found in intra-operative complications (RAC+ 0.7% <i>vs.</i> vaginal 10.6%). Furthermore, the total number of complications graded 3a and higher was significantly lower in the RAC + group [OR 0.3 (0.2-0.7)]. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Although RAC + entailed a more extensive procedure, compared to vaginal colpectomy, RAC + had a lower risk of severe peri-operative complications, requiring re-intervention; intra-operative blood loss was lower and hospital stay shorter. Both routes of colpectomy are complex procedures with potentially severe complications. Future studies are needed to study whether robot-colpectomy could be a safe alternative to vaginal colpectomy in patients with a previous hysterectomy.",

    "title": "Energy dependence of synchronization mode transitions in the delay-coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo system driven by chaotic activity.",
    "abstract": "Energy absorption and consumption are essential for the activity of single neurons and neuronal networks. The synchronization mode transition and energy dependence in a delay-coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuronal system driven by chaotic activity are investigated in this paper. With the change of chaotic current intensity, it was found that the synchronization mode of coupled neurons undergoes synchronous state, transition state, anti-phase state, alternating asynchronous and anti-phase state, and chaotic current-induced chaotic state. The Hamiltonian energy is much dependent on the synchronization mode of coupled neurons. The synchronization mode and the Hamiltonian energy of coupled neurons can be modulated by chaotic current intensity, coupling strength and time delay. The introduction of the time delay induces the system to become bistable state. Chaotic current as an external force induced transitions between the synchronous and anti-phase states. Coupling strength is an intrinsic property of the system and can change the properties of the bistable state. Furthermore, the synchronous and anti-phase states appear intermittently with the increasing of time delay. A chained neuronal network is used to prove that the synchronization mode transition of the system of multiple neurons is similar to the two neurons. The results of this paper might help one to understand the intrinsic energy alteration mechanisms of neuronal synchronization.",

    "abstract": "This article aims to analyze data on care in the field of public mental healthcare in Brazil from 2012 to 2022, corresponding to the years before and after the implementation of the New Mental Health Policy. For this purpose, quantitative methodology, of the longitudinal ecological study type, was used. Data was extracted for the period from 2012 to 2022. The sources used were Health Information Systems. The data was compiled into time series and analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques. The results pointed to the enhancement of outpatient services and a decrease in the expansion of Psychosocial Care Centers and Primary Care facilities after 2017, indicating compliance with the New Policy guidelines to deprioritize territorial and community-based services. The number of psychiatric hospitals showed little variation for the entire period, indicating not only alignment with the strengthening of hospital institutions indicated in the New Policy, but also weaknesses in the deinstitutionalization policy of the period prior to 2017. This study concludes that the effects of the changes in national policies on the organization, management and execution of the health system can be seen, but at the same time there is continuity in various aspects.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) can reduce mortality and improve physical functioning in older patients, but current programs do not support the needs of older patients with comorbidities or frailty, for example due to transport problems and physical limitations. Home-exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (HEBCR) programs may better meet these needs, but physiotherapy guidelines for personalising HEBCR for older, frail patients with cardiovascular disease are lacking. To provide expert recommendations for physiotherapists on how to administer HEBCR to older adults with comorbidities or frailty. This Delphi study involved a panel of Dutch experts in physiotherapy, exercise physiology, and cardiology. Three Delphi rounds were conducted between December 2020 and February 2022. In the first round panellists provided expertise on applicability and adaptability of existing CR-guidelines. In the second round panellists ranked the importance of statements about HEBCR for older adults. In the third round panellists re-ranked statements when individual scores were outside the semi-interquartile range. Consensus was defined as a semi-interquartile range of ≤ 1.0. Of 20 invited panellists, 11 (55%) participated. Panellists were clinical experts with a median (interquartile range) work experience of 20 (10.5) years. The panel reached a consensus on 89% of statements, identifying key topics such as implementing the patient perspective, assessing comorbidity and frailty barriers to exercise, and focusing on personal goals and preferences. This Delphi study provides recommendations for personalised HEBCR for older, frail patients with cardiovascular disease, which can improve the effectiveness of CR-programs and address the needs of this patient population. Prioritising interventions aimed at enhancing balance, lower extremity strength, and daily activities over interventions targeting exercise capacity may contribute to a more holistic and effective approach, particularly for older adults.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted with individuals of both sexes, aged 20 to 59 years. DPs were identified using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Binary logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Three DPs were identified: Dual, Ultra-processed (UP), and Traditional. The Dual DP explained the highest variance in 2015/16 (15.4%), while in 2019, it was the UP DP (15.1%). In 2015/16, the Dual DP was related to the age groups of 20-29 years and 30-40 years, with no associations in 2019. The Traditional DP was associated with physical activity in 2015/16 and, in 2019, with living with ≥5 people in the household, lower education, and overweight. The dietary patterns in 2019 showed a stronger association with social determinants, indicating a greater influence of these factors on eating habits.",

    "abstract": "Investigations into long-term fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure's impact on nonaccidental and cardiovascular (CVD) deaths primarily involve nonrepresentative adult populations at concentrations above the new Environmental Protection Agency annual PM 2.5 standard. Using generalized linear models, we studied PM 2.5 exposure on rates of five mortality outcomes (all nonaccidental, CVD, myocardial infarction, stroke, and congestive heart failure) in 12 US states from 2000 to 2016. We aggregated predicted annual PM 2.5 exposures from a validated ensemble exposure model, ambient temperature from Daymet predictions, and mortality rates to all census tract-years within the states. We obtained covariates from the decennial Census and the American Community Surveys and assessed effect measure modification by race and education with stratification. For each 1-µg/m 3 increase in annual PM 2.5 , we found positive associations with all five mortality outcomes: all nonaccidental (1.08%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96%, 1.20%), all CVD (1.27%; 95% CI: 1.14%, 1.41%), myocardial infarction (1.89%; 95% CI: 1.67%, 2.11%), stroke (1.08%; 95% CI: 0.87%, 1.30%), and congestive heart failure (2.20%; 95% CI: 1.97%, 2.44%). Positive associations persisted at <8 µg/m 3 PM 2.5 levels and among populations with only under 65. In our study, race, but not education, modifies associations. High-educated Black had a 2.90% larger increased risk of CVD mortality (95% CI: 2.42%, 3.39%) compared with low-educated non-Black. Long-term PM 2.5 exposure is associated with nonaccidental and CVD mortality in 12 states, below the new Environmental Protection Agency standard, for both low PM 2.5 regions and the general population. Vulnerability to CVD mortality persists among Black individuals regardless of education level.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease patients are exposed to frequent procedures and hospital admissions as well as recurrent need for radiological examinations with a high risk of exposure to radiation and contrast. Our objective was to evaluate the role of a combination of both intestinal ultrasound (IUS) and colour Doppler with different parameters for monitoring changes in inflammation over time and to reveal their potential role in the assessment of response to biologic therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Before the induction of biological therapy, IUS together with colour Doppler of the intestine was conducted. Response to therapy was defined following the international guidelines. A total of 45 patients with histopathological diagnosis of IBD were enrolled in the study. All patients received biological therapy and were assessed for response after 3 months. Out of those patients, 34 (75.6%) had good response while 11 (24.4%) failed to respond to the treatment. Our findings point to a strong association between bowel wall thickening (BWT) and serum albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and c-reactive protein (CRP). The overall sensitivity of IUS varied from 54 to 93% when evaluating bowel affection, with a specificity of 97-100%, in comparison to our results, which showed a sensitivity of 64-74% and specificity of 79-82%. Doppler parameters could predict the response to the biologic therapy in IBD patients. Intestinal ultrasound and colour Doppler provide a safe, non-invasive way to monitor changes in inflammation and blood flow in the digestive tract.",

Out of 864 gram-negative isolates, 710 were phenotypically identified as multidrug-resistant by antibiotic susceptibility testing. From the above isolates, 102 representative isolates as per sample size calculated were selected for further molecular studies. The presence of blaTEM, blaCTX-M blaSHV, and five AmpC genes was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conventional PCR was performed to detect seven aminoglycoside modifying enzyme genes namely aac(6')-Ib, aac(6')-Ic, aac(3)-Ia, aac(3)-Ib, aac(3)-IIa, ant(2'')-Ia, and ant(4'')-IIa. Most common multidrug-resistant isolate was Klebsiella pneumoniae (35%) followed by Escherichia coli (30%). Among the 102 selected isolates all harboured blaTEM gene, 71 (69.6%) harboured blaCTX-M gene and 48 (47%) blaSHV gene. Among the selected isolates 60% showed the presence of AmpC genes. Most common aminoglycosie modifying enzyme gene was AAC 6' Ib (51%) followed by ANT 2\" Ia (36%). This study suggests a wider use of molecular methods using specific PCR amplification of resistance genes. It would be beneficial to perform the molecular identification of antimicrobial resistance genes to effectively monitor and manage antibiotic resistance, administer appropriate antimicrobial medication, practice antimicrobial stewardship and improve hospital infection control procedures.",

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is one of the opportunistic pathogens that may cause serious health problems and can produce several virulence factors, which are responsible for various infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. They are responsible for producing infections on indwelling medical devices by attaching on to them and forming a biofilm. Antibiofilm, antivirulence, and gene expression studies of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm treated with esters of flavonols were evaluated. Pyocyanin, cell surface hydrophobicity, LasA protease estimation, rhamnolipid estimation, and pyoverdine estimation were performed to evaluate the antivirulence activities of the test compounds against <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Previous studies on the antivirulence activity of flavonoids against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> demonstrate that even if they can inhibit bacterial growth, relatively high concentrations of the compound are generally required for the inhibition of virulence factors. The esters showed more than 40% inhibition in all the tested virulence factors at their sub minimum inhibitory concentration. The gene expression studies of selected esters toward <i>lasB</i> and <i>rhlA</i> genes show downregulation of <i>rhlA</i> which suggests the inhibition in biofilm formation through rhamnolipid inhibition, quorum sensing inhibition, or biofilm formation inhibition.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

    "abstract": "Experimental single-centre study of X-ray absorption using a phantom skull. This experimental study aimed to compare the radiation doses of different 3D imaging devices used in maxillofacial surgery, including one Multidetector CT (MDCT), two Conebeam CT (CBCT) and four intraoperative 3D C-arms. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to determine the absorbed radiation in an Alderson-Rando phantom skull. The phantom skull was positioned in the before mentioned seven devices and a defined 3D facial skull image was acquired. Subsequently, the TLD'S were read out and the effective doses (ED) and the organ doses (OD) were calculated and compared. OD varied significantly between tissues as well as between the 3D X-ray devices. The OD of the 3D C-arms were significantly lower than those of all other devices. The OD of the CT, especially in the standard setting, was the highest. Only by special adjustments of the scan protocol regarding CMF requirements for traumatology, the MDCT could achieve almost equivalent doses as the two tested CBCT-scanners. The calculated effective doses were also lowest for the 3D C-arm devices (11.2 to 129.9 μSv). The ED of the MDCT were significant higher (284.52-844.97 μSv) than in all other devices. The ED of the CBCTs (173.7-184.9) were lower than for MDCT but still higher than those of the 3D C-arms. Intraoperative imaging using 3D C-arm devices is an effective method to verify reduction results in maxillofacial surgery intraoperatively with significantly lower ED than postoperatively CBCT and MDCT imaging.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to compare the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning model that was trained on a dataset of normal and abnormal paediatric elbow radiographs with that of paediatric emergency department (ED) physicians on a binomial classification task. A total of 1,314 paediatric elbow lateral radiographs (patient mean age 8.2 years) were retrospectively retrieved and classified based on annotation as normal or abnormal (with pathology). They were then randomly partitioned to a development set (993 images); first and second tuning (validation) sets (109 and 100 images, respectively); and a test set (112 images). An artificial intelligence (AI) model was trained on the development set using the EfficientNet B1 network architecture. Its performance on the test set was compared to that of five physicians (inter-rater agreement: fair). Performance of the AI model and the physician group was tested using McNemar test. The accuracy of the AI model on the test set was 80.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71.8%-87.3%), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.872 (95% CI 0.831-0.947). The performance of the AI model vs. the physician group on the test set was: sensitivity 79.0% (95% CI: 68.4%-89.5%) vs. 64.9% (95% CI: 52.5%-77.3%; P = 0.088); and specificity 81.8% (95% CI: 71.6%-92.0%) vs. 87.3% (95% CI: 78.5%-96.1%; P = 0.439). The AI model showed good AUROC values and higher sensitivity, with the P-value at nominal significance when compared to the clinician group.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown restrictions introduced personal and relationship stressors that potentially increased the risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) for some. We estimated the population prevalence and correlates of fearing a partner in the first year of the pandemic in Britain. We used data from Natsal-COVID Wave 2-a web-panel survey undertaken one year after the initial British lockdown from 23 March 2020. Quotas and weighting were used to achieve a quasi-representative sample of the general population. Participants were asked about fearing a partner, which is a simple and valid screening tool to identify IPV experiences. In our sample (unweighted <i>n</i> = 6302, aged 18-59), 9.0% of women and 8.7% of men reported fearing a partner in the first year of the pandemic. Women (73.3%) were more likely than men (49.9%) to indicate that fearing a partner made them feel anxious or depressed; men were more likely to report increased substance use (30.8% vs. 18.4%) and affected work/studies (30.0% vs. 20.0%). For both women and men, fearing a partner during the first year of the pandemic was associated with established health and wellbeing outcomes like anxiety/depression, alcohol use, accessing sexual/reproductive health services, and relationship dissolution as well as feeling that the \"pandemic made things worse\" across various life domains. Population-level estimates of IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic highlight harmful experiences that occurred alongside other wide-ranging hardships, and the associations presented identify key populations with potential ongoing need. We make recommendations for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of IPV.",

It seeks to understand how the pleasure felt at work plays a role in the slower evolution and lesser intensity of repetitive strain injuries (RSI) observed in the profession of quilombola shellfish gatherers compared to other professions in the salaried sector, such as the service sector, for example. In this way, research into the psychodynamics of work was carried out with artisanal fisherwomen in quilombola communities in two regions of Baía de Todos Santos - State of Bahia, from 2021 to 2023. The conclusion drawn was that the sublimation and pleasure involved in the work activities of these professionals can contribute to maintaining their physical and mental health, even though they are subjected to the constraints of intense workloads. Thus, the importance of pleasure at work for the construction of mental health was reaffirmed during this research.",

A longitudinal analysis was performed with baseline and follow-up data from ELSA-Brasil. At baseline, 15,105 civil servants were enrolled. After exclusions, the final sample consisted of 3,591 participants. Anthropometric and lifestyle data were collected, and abdominal obesity was diagnosed in accordance with the World Health Organization parameters. The t-test and chi-square test were applied, and crude and adjusted Poisson models were assessed. The results revealed that more than 70% of the sample reported alcohol use. In nine years, an increase in abdominal obesity and alcohol consumption was observed among men and women. A total of 1,588 new cases of abdominal obesity were identified. Higher alcohol consumption increased the risk of abdominal obesity in men (1.15, 95%CI 1.01-1.31, p < 0.001). The conclusion drawn was that after a follow-up period of 9 years, the highest risk of abdominal obesity was observed only in men who increased their alcohol consumption.",

    "title": "Fat Expansion Not Fat Infiltration of Muscle Post Rotator Cuff Tendon Tears of the Shoulder: Regenerative Engineering Implications.",
    "abstract": "Rotator cuff (RC) tears affect many individuals around the globe. Ambiguity of rotator cuff repair surgical outcomes is currently a limitation that is associated with fat accumulation and atrophy in the rotator cuff muscles. To improve the efficacy of rotator cuff repairs, a deeper understanding of the root causes is required. Traditionally, the term \"fat infiltration\" has been used to described fatty changes in muscle after rotator cuff tears. This paper introduces the concept of fat expansion as a more appropriate description for the appearance of fatty rotator cuff tear pathological changes. Furthermore, the contribution of fibroadipogenic progenitor (FAP) cells to pathological changes associated with rotator cuff injuries is presented to characterize the molecular basis of impairment. Lastly, the field of regenerative engineering is discussed as a promising solution to the pathological changes associated with rotator cuff tears. The connection between fatty infiltration, fat expansion, fat accumulation, fibroadipogenic cells, and regenerative engineering in the context of rotator cuff tears was explored using the databases PubMed and Google Scholar. Numerous articles have supported the role of muscle resident fibroadipogenic cells as a contributor to rotator cuff tear pathological changes. In addition, regenerative engineering solutions prove to improve the pathological changes associated with rotator cuff tears. The term fat expansion is more appropriate to describe fat accumulation associated with rotator cuff tears, and the employment of regenerative engineering treatment strategies improve the pathological changes associated with rotator cuff tears. Fat accumulation after rotator cuff tears has been associated with post-operative complications. Infiltration or entering of adipocytes from the external muscle environment has historically been the reported cause of the rapid increase in fat and muscle atrophy observed after rotor cuff tears. This review will dismiss the use of the term fat infiltration and acknowledge the implications of muscle resident stem cells, known as fibroadipogenic (FAP) cells, to rotator cuff tear pathological changes. Additionally, regenerative engineering, a field which seeks to regenerate various tissues using biomaterial-based scaffolds and stem cells, will be discussed as a potential solution for pathological changes.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the mutual effects between the different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is crucial for comprehending the formation mechanism of atmospheric secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Here, the mixed VOCs experiments of isoprene and Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene/β-caryophyllene were carried out in the presence of O<sub>3</sub> using an indoor smog chamber. The suppression effect of isoprene was recognized by the scanning mobility particle sizer spectrometer, online vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser (VUV-FEL) photoionization aerosol mass spectrometry, and quantum chemical calculations. The results indicate that the suppression effect of isoprene on the ozonolysis of Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene and β-caryophyllene shows fluctuating and monotonous trends, respectively. The carbon content of the precursor could be the main factor for regulating the strength of the suppression effect. Plausible structures and formation mechanisms of several new products generated from the single VOC precursor and VOC-cross-reaction are proposed, which enrich the category of VOC oxidation products. Meanwhile, a new dimerization mechanism of the RO<sub>2</sub> + R'O<sub>2</sub> reaction is suggested, which offers an intriguing perspective on the gas phase formation process of particle phase accretion products. The present findings provide valuable insights into clarifying the pivotal roles played by isoprene in the interplay between different VOCs and understanding of SOA formation mechanisms of VOC mixtures, especially nearby the emission origins.",

In this paper, we introduce a new variant of SBC to alleviate several known problems. Our variant allows the user to in principle detect any possible issue with the posterior, while previously reported implementations could never detect large classes of problems including when the posterior is equal to the prior. This is made possible by including additional data-dependent test quantities when running SBC. We argue and demonstrate that the joint likelihood of the data is an especially useful test quantity. Some other types of test quantities and their theoretical and practical benefits are also investigated. We provide theoretical analysis of SBC, thereby providing a more complete understanding of the underlying statistical mechanisms. We also bring attention to a relatively common mistake in the literature and clarify the difference between SBC and checks based on the data-averaged posterior. We support our recommendations with numerical case studies on a multivariate normal example and a case study in implementing an ordered simplex data type for use with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The SBC variant introduced in this paper is implemented in the SBC R package.",

RevMan software (version 5.3) was used to calculate the pooled effect estimates for operative and postoperative variables. In the systemic review, 20 studies, including 10 randomized controlled trials, were assessed. In the TVT versus autologous pubovaginal sling (A-PVS) groups, the effect estimates for the surgical duration, catheter duration, success, and complication rates were more advantageous for TVT. However, in comparison to autologous transobturator tape groups, TOT provided better operative time and a shorter hospital stay. Moreover, in comparison to the A-PVS group, the TOT group was superior in terms of operating time, urethral catheterization, hospital stay, amount of residual urine, and wound complications. The A-PVS group had significantly more groin and thigh pain. During medium- and long-term follow-ups, the use of autologous rectus fascia grafts using a A-PVS or TOT provided similar complication rates and urinary continence results as using midurethral synthetic meshes (TVT and TOT).",

Following T9-T10 laminectomy and contusion to the spinal cord, female rats received either intrathecal (IT) PEP, IT ringer-lactate solution (RL), intravenous (IV) PEP, or IV RL one day post injury. Rats underwent behavioral assessments each week for 10 weeks following SCI. After 10 weeks, histological evaluations were performed to quantity axon myelination and cavity size. The IT PEP group had significantly (P ≤ 0.05) more myelinated axons 1000 μm rostral to the injury, at the epicenter, and 1000 μm caudal of the injury (34.3 ± 3.1, 27.7 ± 2.1, and 32.0 ± 1.7, respectively) compared to the IT RL group (27.3 ± 2.5, 17.3 ± 2.5, and 23.3 ± 2.5, respectively). In addition, IT PEP rats had significantly reduced cavity size at the injury epicenter compared to controls (28.31%±1.74% vs. 34.39%±3.78%, respectively). Lastly, functional improvements were observed and sustained beginning at the 31 days following injury. The IV PEP group did not show sustained functional improvement compared to the IV RL rats. Our results suggest that IT PEP injection may yield beneficial effects following SCI. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the role of PEP following SCI and to optimize its potential for clinical translation.",

    "title": "A Longitudinal Two-Armed Randomized Controlled Trial Protocol to Evaluate the Efficacy of Yoga on Progression of Disease in Early Parkinson's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that yoga can aid patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in managing their motor function, functional mobility, balance, anxiety, and overall quality of life. However, most of the reported research either needed more power or evaluated the results during or after the intervention. Due to the long-standing nature of PD, there are still few longitudinal studies investigating the potential of yoga to decrease the progression of the disease. We study whether sustained adjunct yoga intervention slows PD progression. Over 18 months, this study will investigate the long-term benefits of yoga-based intervention in Parkinson's patients. The concept of \"intention-to-treat (ITT)\" will be employed. From the outpatient clinic of the Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana in India, 160 patients with PD will be chosen. They will then be randomly assigned to either the interventional or control groups (1:1). The adjunct intervention group will participate in 21 daily contact yoga sessions (60 min) at the University Medical Center, followed by continued tele-supervised home practice and at-home self-practice. The effectiveness of the adjunct intervention will be evaluated at four different time points (baseline, 3-, 9-, 12-, and 18-month post-randomization). The primary endpoint will be the difference in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score at baseline and after 18 months of intervention. Secondary outcomes will include subscores of MDS-UPDRS I, II, and IV, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 scores, treatment adherence, the PDQ-39, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21, and the Scales for Outcomes in PD-Sleep Scale (SCOPA-S). The primary outcome will be analyzed using mixed-effect models for repeated measures, adjusted for covariates as fixed effects. The protocol was conceptualized in October 2021 and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of SVYASA. Recruitment began in February 2022 and is underway with patient enrollment. To our knowledge, this is the first controlled study to examine the long-term effects of yoga as an adjuvant therapy on the progression of PD. This would be the first long-term trial to assess the potential of an adjunct yoga intervention to modulate disease progression in early Parkinson's patients.",

    "abstract": "The P53 protein, a cancer-associated transcriptional factor and tumor suppressor, houses a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion in its DNA-binding domain (DBD), essential for sequence-specific DNA binding. However, common mutations at position 273, specifically from Arginine to Histidine and Cysteine, lead to a loss of function as a tumor suppressor, also called DNA contact mutations. The mutant (MT) P53 structure cannot stabilize DNA due to inadequate interaction. To investigate the conformational changes, we performed a comparative molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) to study the effect of the P53-Wildtype (P53-WT) and the DNA contact mutations (R273H and R273C) on the DBD. Our research indicated that the DNA binding bases lose Hydrogen bonds (H bonds) when mutated to P53-R273H and P53-R273C during the simulation. We employed tools, such as PDIviz to highlight the contacts with DNA bases and backbone, major and minor grooves, and various pharmacophore forms of atoms. The contact maps for R273H and R273C were generated using the COZOID tool, which displayed changes in the frequency of the amino acids and DNA bases interaction in the DNA binding domain. These residues have diminished interactions, and the zinc-binding domain shows significant movements by Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion binding to the phosphate group of the DNA, moving away from its binding sites. In conclusion, our research suggests that R273H and R273C each have unique stability and self-assembly properties. This understanding might assist researchers in better comprehending the function of the p53 protein and its importance in cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

    "title": "Rates of Receiving Medication for Opioid Use Disorder and Opioid Overdose Deaths During the Early Synthetic Opioid Crisis: A County-level Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Medications for opioid use disorder are associated with a lower risk of drug overdoses at the individual level. However, little is known about whether these effects translate to population-level reductions. We investigated whether county-level efforts to increase access to medication for opioid use disorder in 2012-2014 were associated with opioid overdose deaths in New York State during the first years of the synthetic opioid crisis. We performed an ecologic county-level study including data from 60 counties (2010-2018). We calculated rates of people receiving medication for opioid use disorder among the population misusing opioids in 2012-2014 and categorized counties into quartiles of this exposure. We modeled synthetic and nonsynthetic opioid overdose death rates using Bayesian hierarchical models. Counties with higher rates of receiving medications for opioid use disorder in 2012-2014 had lower synthetic opioid overdose deaths in 2016 (highest vs. lowest quartile: rate ratio [RR] = 0.33, 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.12, 0.98; and second-highest vs. lowest: RR = 0.20, 95% CrI = 0.07, 0.59) and 2017 (quartile second-highest vs. lowest: RR = 0.22, 95% CrI = 0.06, 0.83), but not 2018. There were no differences in nonsynthetic opioid overdose death rates comparing higher quartiles versus lowest quartile of exposure. A spatio-temporal modeling approach incorporating counts of the population misusing opioids provided information about trends and interventions in the target population. Higher rates of receiving medications for opioid use disorder in 2012-2014 were associated with lower rates of synthetic opioid overdose deaths early in the crisis.",

    "abstract": "Studies examining the intersectional effects of sexual orientation and racial/ethnic discrimination among sexual minority people of color have produced mixed results, supporting a range of hypotheses. Some studies find that both types of discrimination additively predict poorer health (additive hypothesis), while others find that only one type of discrimination predicts health (prominence hypothesis). Still other studies demonstrate multiplicative effects, whereby one type of discrimination has a stronger effect on health when the other type of discrimination is high (multiplicative hypothesis). The current study aims to add clarity to the literature by examining all three hypotheses separately for different racial/ethnic groups. We utilized data from a longitudinal study of substance use among sexual minority cisgender women of color and sexual minority gender diverse people of color assigned female at birth. We tested all three hypotheses cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results provided substantial support for the prominence hypothesis. Findings also provided some support for the multiplicative hypothesis and for unique patterns of interactions not directly theorized by any of the three hypotheses. Little evidence for the additive hypothesis was observed. Nuanced differences in patterns of findings across racial/ethnic groups were obscured when people of color were treated as a single homogeneous group. The most support was found for the prominence hypothesis; however, this hypothesis receives the least empirical attention, highlighting a direction for future research. Further, results suggest that examining intersectional effects separately for different racial/ethnic groups may be more appropriate than combining all people of color in a single set of analyses.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the prevalence of biologic and technical/mechanical complications in an edentulous older population rehabilitated with complete removable dental prostheses (CDs) and overdentures (toothretained [ODs], implant-retained [IODs]). Patient records of adults (> 60 years) rehabilitated with CDs, ODs, and IODs were included. Demographic information (age, sex), information on the prostheses type, number and type of biologic/prosthetic complications, and the number and time of the complications were extracted. Kaplan-Meier model was used for statistical analyses. A total of 162 patients (mean age: 74.5 ± 9.45 years; n = 224 prostheses: CD = 172, OD = 21, IOD = 31) were included. The average period of function in situ was 19.70 ± 27.66, 32.72 ± 27.84, and 31.73 ± 32.67 months for the CDs, ODs, and IODs, respectively. Five prostheses failed. Survival analysis revealed an overall survival rate (SR) of 97.8%, with individual 5-year cumulative survival probability of 96.1% for CDs, 94.1% for ODs, and 100.0% for IODs. There were no significant survival differences between maxillary and mandibular prostheses within each type of rehabilitation. In the maxilla, no significant differences were found in maintenance visit times due to prosthodontic complications among the different types of prostheses. Patients with mandibular CDs required maintenance visits earlier compared to mandibular ODs (P < .001) and IODs (P < .001). Patients with mandibular ODs also required maintenance visits earlier than those with mandibular IODs (P = .005). Rehabilitation of the edentulous arches, whether with CDs, ODs, or IODs, is a predictable treatment modality with high SRs. Differences in maintenance visit times were observed, with CDs and ODs in the mandible requiring earlier visits compared to IODs.",

    "abstract": "Caregivers and their children with clinical levels of feeding problems participated in Picnic Group, an outpatient interdisciplinary family group treatment program for children with feeding disorders and their caregivers at a large regional pediatric hospital. The manualized treatment is based on an interdisciplinary systematic approach that draws from sensory integration, communication, and cognitive behavioral strategies (e.g., classical conditioning, systematic desensitization, communication of automatic thoughts) to increase pleasurable interactions with food over a 12-week period and includes caregiver and child intervention components. Escape extinction techniques such as nonremoval of the spoon were not used in treatment. Caregivers completed measures focused on their children's feeding behaviors and family strain at baseline and at the end of the 12-week intervention. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared measures between baseline and the end of treatment. Results indicated that at the 12th week, caregivers generally reported one less feeding problem, fewer specific types of eating and mealtime problematic behaviors, and decreased impact of feeding problems on the family. Children were able to work up a hierarchy of food interactions with more foods per group session than at the first session. Caregivers of children with a developmental diagnosis showed the most decrease in caregiver strain. Outpatient interdisciplinary group treatment can decrease feeding problems and caregiver strain in families with children with feeding disorders.",

The effect of anti-tubercular treatment, specimen type, and imaging findings on laboratory results was also assessed along with a comparison of imaging findings in tubercular versus non-tubercular cases. This prospective observational study, planned for CT-guided aspiration/ biopsy, included 70 adults with suspected tuberculous spondylitis. Specimens were sent for microscopy, histopathology, TB culture, and Gene Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The correlation of sampling location, specimen type, anti-tubercular treatment, and imaging findings on microbiology results was documented. A definite diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis was obtained in 50 cases. The assay had a 100 % agreement for smear-positive, culture-positive, specimens while the overall agreement was 41.3 %. Rifampicin resistance was detected in 8 cases. Seventy-one percent of patients were on empiric ATT. Imaging findings such as end plate destruction, paravertebral soft tissue thickening and abscess, disc involvement, sequestrum, and bony fragments were significantly associated with a final diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis. The Gene Xpert MTB/RIF assay performed on specimens obtained by CT-guided aspiration/biopsy is a sensitive and rapid method of establishing a diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis even in cases on ATT.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests that teams can greatly enhance their performance through boundary management, which comprises activities that establish, maintain, and regulate linkages with the surrounding environment. However, such performance gains do not materialize equally in all instances, and some teams struggle to benefit from boundary management. Integrating insights from social network and team-level resource allocation theories, we develop a contingency framework that considers the internal organization of a team's boundary management (i.e., the carrier, target, and type of such activities) as a key moderating factor that accounts for the varying effects. To test this framework, we use a meta-analytic approach that synthesizes >30 years of empirical research (i.e., 85 primary studies covering 10,848 teams). Our results show a positive main effect of team boundary management on team performance. Crucially, these performance benefits are more pronounced when the target of boundary management is extraorganizational rather than inside the home organization and when the type of boundary management activities is boundary spanning (e.g., coordination, representation, or information search) rather than boundary strengthening (e.g., buffering, guarding, or sentry activities). Moreover, boundary management is more effective when executed by formal team leaders rather than team members, and our results tentatively suggest that this may reflect differences in effectiveness between leaders and members in boundary strengthening, rather than boundary spanning. Overall, our findings advance theory on team boundary management by clarifying previously ambiguous findings and illustrating how teams can design their boundary management activities to be most effective.",

    "abstract": "Most audio-visual (AV) emotion databases consist of clips that do not reflect real-life emotion processing (e.g., professional actors in bright studio-like environment), contain only spoken clips, and none have sung clips that express complex emotions. Here, we introduce a new AV database, the Reading Everyday Emotion Database (REED), which directly addresses those gaps. We recorded the faces of everyday adults with a diverse range of acting experience expressing 13 emotions-neutral, the six basic emotions (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, surprised), and six complex emotions (embarrassed, hopeful, jealous, proud, sarcastic, stressed)-in two auditory domains (spoken and sung) using everyday recording devices (e.g., laptops, mobile phones, etc.). The recordings were validated by an independent group of raters. We found that: intensity ratings of the recordings were positively associated with recognition accuracy; and the basic emotions, as well as the Neutral and Sarcastic emotions, were recognised more accurately than the other complex emotions. Emotion recognition accuracy also differed by utterance. Exploratory analysis revealed that recordings of those with drama experience were better recognised than those without. Overall, this database will benefit those who need AV clips with natural variations in both emotion expressions and recording environment.

Then I raise four worries about the application of his methodology that give rise to corresponding general recommendations for how to do empirical political philosophy. Proponents of this approach should take care to (1) check for inappropriately narrow (and broad) samples, (2) verify studies' relevance for their empirical hypotheses, (3) adjust their confidence to the available empirical evidence, and (4) properly integrate their hypotheses into their philosophical theorizing.",

    "abstract": "The forecasting of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere is essential as it causes the pollution of the atmosphere and hence severe health problems for humans. This study proposes a time-series prognosis EEMD-SVD-MA technique which incorporates Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition and Moving Average, to predict the prospects of carbon monoxide data taken from the Indian region. The collected data are non-linear. The technique can be applied for non-stationary and non-linear data. In this approach, there are three levels: EEMD level, SVD level and MA level. The first level deploys EEMD to fragment data series into a limited number of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) components along with a residue. To denoise each IMF component, SVD is deployed in the second level. In the third level, each denoised IMF component is predicted by MA. The future values of the original data are obtained by adding all the predicted series of the components. In this study, we proposed two variants of the model: EEMD-SVD-MA(3) and EEMD-SVD-MA(4) and compared the results with other forecasting techniques, namely LSTM (Long Short Term Memory network), EMD-LSTM, EMD-MA, EEMD-MA and CEEMDAN-MA. The results show that the proposed EEMD-SVD-MA model is more efficient than other models.",
